    "description": "For Army Reserve Soldier Michael Cross, the world as he knew it ended in an instant. One minute, he's in college, and in the next, rioters are roaming the highway around him, breaking into cars, and literally tearing people apart. This is the day the dead walk. This is the world of We're Alive.\nWe’re Alive is an ongoing series, packing performances and sound effects that rival movies and prove that modern audio drama is undead and well. Join our survivors as they band together, struggle to fortify a safe haven known as the Tower, and discovers that zombies are far from the worst thing in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where the rules of human decency no longer apply.\nWe premiere 3 New episodes a month, with a week off between chapters.\nLittle food. Little water. Little hope. Who is lucky enough to say \"We're Alive?\"",

            "description": "<p>We’re Alive launches a new, 10-episode season entitled “Goldrush” on Tuesday September 10th, 2019 online, with a live event release of the season premiere on September 7th 2019 at the Assistance League Theater in Los Angeles. Debuting its 6th season, We’re Alive began back in 2009 and has been downloaded over 160 million times worldwide.</p>\n<p>Written, directed and produced by Kc Wayland, Goldrush dives back into the series with an adventure that spans the time of the series. Four soldiers (Puck, Muldoon, Robbins, and Carl) stumble across clues to a hidden gold heist stash. Since gold retains value even after the apocalypse, they plot to track down the prize for themselves. The “goldrush” is a fever of greed, that could ultimately consume and destroy them. The values of camaraderie and companionship are tested as they embark on a secret adventure to become ultra-rich in this spaghetti-western tale of humor, horror and heartbreak. Wayland Productions has partnered with Podcast One to release the series, starring Anthony Reyes, Shaun Lewin, Brett Newton, Christian Vieira, Brenna Otts, Erin Breen, Christy Carlson Romano (Kim Possible, Even Stevens), and guest starring Danny Trejo. And will release on the following schedule:</p>\n<p>10 September 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 1</p>\n<p>17 September 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 2</p>\n<p>18 September 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 3</p>\n<p>24 September 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 4</p>\n<p>1 Oct 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 5</p>\n<p>8 Oct 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 6</p>\n<p>15 Oct 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 7</p>\n<p>22 Oct 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 8</p>\n<p>29 Oct 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 9</p>\n<p>30 Oct 2019 – 7 AM PST Behind the Mic – Audio Documentary</p>\n<p>5 Nov 2019 – 7 AM PST Chapter 10</p>\n<p>For tickets and more information on the release, visit our website: <a href=\"http://www.werealive.com\" target=\"_self\">www.werealive.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",
