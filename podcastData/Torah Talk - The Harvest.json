    "description": "Torah Talk, hosted by Senior Pastor Mark McLellan and presented by The Harvest (Kehilat T'nuvah), is a purposeful deliberation that challenges 2000 years of misunderstanding and neglect of the Torah in the Christian Church. The Harvest is a Messianic, Charismatic Congregation in Thornton, Colorado, just North of Downtown Denver. We believe that this podcast will give you a fresh perspective on your life and on the world you live in.  Blessings and Shalom!",

For those who know God and His ways, it will not be surprising.  However, for our current culture, God’s way of handling this travesty will be seen as being too harsh. This is due to the fact that for many, the perp needs the mercy and not the victim.  It is very sad.  But, if we implement the principles of God’s strategy, we can and will reduce dramatically the amount of those dehumanized and destroyed by this modern-day version of slavery.  Let’s get done for the sake of the victims!!! ",

These are commonly referred to as the Ten Commandments.  They are the foundational laws of the covenant and all laws that come later. Seeing that God Himself spoke these words and wrote the in stone with His own finger, these fundamental commandments are to be cherished, and exalted higher than all other laws! It is alarming to see a growing trend in Christianity to either modify them or dismiss them as no longer obligatory.  However, in Messianic Judaism, they are be exalted and safeguarded once again.  If Christianity returns to the Law of God she will become relevant and influential in the world today, if not she will continue to be marginalized.",
