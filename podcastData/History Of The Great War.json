The ANZAC troops from Australia and New Zealand now find themselves in the shallow beachhead at Anzac Cove. The 29th Division and the Royal Naval Division are ensconced in the trenches not too far from their landing beaches at Helles. None of the landings had really achieved their goals so they now had to launch more attacks to try and get further inland. Today we will discuss these attacks that began shortly after the landings and went all through the summer. But first we talk about the fighting conditions that the troops had to endure while they were living and fighting on the peninsula. ",

Then we will dive into some specific preparations happening on the ground that were unique to the attack at Verdun. The German troops then had to suffer through weeks of waiting for the weather to be right for the attack, which was a painful and slow process given the winter weather that blew through the region in early February 1916.",
