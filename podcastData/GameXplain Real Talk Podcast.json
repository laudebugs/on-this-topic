In our first episode, we discuss a TON of things, including the news that Mother 3 might be coming to the US, Undertale potentially coming to Nintendo platforms, Detective Pikachu being episodic, Nintendo's deal with Universal Studios extending to Japan--and more. We also start off with some non-gaming talk about what we've been up to this past week, including TV Shows we've been watching.\n\nMajor Topics Include:\n1) What's the history of Andre, Derrick, and Ash joining GameXplain?\n2)What game got us into gaming?\n3)SNES games we'd like to see remastered\n\n\n8kywqs6p\n",
