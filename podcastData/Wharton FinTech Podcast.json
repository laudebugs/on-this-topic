Farming sugar cane is highly inefficient when it comes to working capital and getting paid. It takes up to 18 months to grow the crop and then another 12 months to get paid for it.\n \nLex’s parents couldn’t afford to send him to university. He clerked at a country law firm, studied law at by correspondence at night and worked pro-bono for the Queensland Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association with a brief to make sure farmers got paid promptly. That principle, and the payment code Lex devised for farmers in Australia, became the foundation of Greensill that still guides the company today.\n \nLex’s vision was always to make finance fairer for everybody. As a business, Greensill is harnessing its technology and financial expertise to accelerate the movement of cash into the real economy.\n \nLex previously established the global SCF business at Morgan Stanley and led the EMEA SCF business at Citi.\n \nLex holds an MBA from Manchester Business School and is a Solicitor of the Supreme Courts of England and Wales, and Queensland.\n \nIn 2018, Lex was awarded the CBE for services to the UK economy.\n \nAbout Greensill\n\nGreensill makes access to finance faster, cheaper and fairer.

In his book, Alex Lazarow explores the framework of dozens of successful entrepreneurs and investors from around the world, acknowledging that entrepreneurship is never a one size fits all approach.\n\nOut-Innovate comes out at an especially relevant time as the COVID-19 crisis threatens VC investing volumes in emerging markets. Armed with data and real-life examples, Alex presents a compelling case to invest in emerging market ecosystems with startups that look a lot more like Camels rather than Unicorns -built for sustainability and resilience to navigate frequent shocks and survive droughts.\n\nMr. Lazarow also reminds us that some of the best technology innovations increasingly come from outside of Silicon Valley. In fact, average returns for emerging-market VCs have outperformed their peers in traditional entrepreneurial hubs over the last fifteen years. By the same token, some of the most relevant fintech startups were born outside of the US. Nubank, a Brazilian company, is the largest independent digital bank in the world, and Ant Financial, a Chinese company, is considered the largest private fintech company worldwide.\n\nOut-Innovate is a must-read for any investor, entrepreneur, and aspiring builder interested in learning about some of the most resourceful founders around the world who are building lasting companies and improving their communities in the process.\n\nAlex Lazarow\n\nAlex Lazarow has worked at the intersection of investing, innovation, and economic development across the public, private, and social sectors for more than a decade. He is a venture capitalist with Cathay Innovation and was previously with Omidyar Network. He is a Kauffman Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations term member, and an adjunct professor specializing in social impact investment and entrepreneurship at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. He is a graduate of Harvard Business School and the University of Manitoba.",

            "datePublished": "Tue, 07 Jul 2020 09:00:01 +0000",
            "description": "Miguel Armaza is joined by David Vélez, Founder and CEO of Nubank, the largest independent digital bank in the world. Nubank has over 25 million clients and has raised $1.2 billion from some of the most prestigious venture capital funds in the globe, including Sequoia, Ribbit Capital, DST, Kaszek Ventures, and QED.\n\nDavid grew up in a family of Colombian entrepreneurs. The concept of being your own boss was engrained in him daily and he always thought he would launch a company at an early age. However, after graduating from Stanford University, he found himself lost at the thought of starting a venture. He didn't know where to even begin. So, he took a more traditional route and joined Morgan Stanley, which later led him to General Atlantic, to focus on growth equity.\n\nArmed with 5 years of investing experience, he went back to Stanford in 2010 to pursue an MBA. His goal was to leverage the MBA experience to find a business idea. However, shortly after starting school, he was approached by non-other than Sequoia Capital to lead their Latin American group. He took the chance, but after almost 3 years with Sequoia, it became evident that the startup ecosystem of the region was not robust enough for them, and the Latin American strategy was scrapped. David saw this as an opportunity and decided it was time to start something.\n\nInspiration\n\nHis painful experience of opening a bank account in Brazil, which he describes as “almost going to jail”, convinced him there was a better way of doing banking in the country. Not only was customer service terrible, but banks were charging astronomically high interest rates to creditworthy customers. This is where Nubank was born.\n\nDuring his years at GA, David had the chance to work alongside Nigel Morris, Co-Founder of Capital One. David credits Capital One as a big inspiration for Nubank, as a data-driven company with a culture focused on recruiting the best analytical talent. Another source of inspiration was Tinkoff, a Russian neobank with a similar focus and excellent customer experience. Additionally, learning from technology companies like Amazon and Netflix convinced David that Nubank should be a technology company that happens to operate in financial services, and not a bank that uses technology. In his own words, “This makes all the difference”.\n\nCulture\n\nIf there’s something that stands out when talking to David, it’s his dogged determination on building a customer-centric company culture that also takes care of its employees. In fact, back in 2013 when launching Nubank, he created two company presentations. One for investors and another one about company culture that he used to recruit his co-founders and first employees. He is clearly proud that the latter hasn't changed much in the last seven years and he continues to deliver this presentation to every single new employee at the company. \n\nInterestingly, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nubank culture has overperformed and employee engagement has never been better. Be it through the creation of a 20 million reais (≈US$3.8 million) fund for customer assistance or by providing over 1,000 remote service stations for their employees to work from home, the pandemic has allowed them to prove to clients and employees that they live and breathe these company values. \n\nPost-COVID World\n\nDavid argues that the current crisis doesn’t necessarily create any new trends, but instead accelerates several tendencies and behaviors that were already taking place. From digitalization to more flexible remote working policies, these trends are only accelerating. However, more importantly, David is convinced the pandemic is forcing companies to rethink their values and embrace a much broader view of capitalism, through a model that requires companies to show integrity and take care of their customers, their people, their communities, and the environment. As evidenced by their recent actions, Nubank is certainly adopting this philosophy.",

Signzy is a FinTech startup offering digital onboarding solutions to enable secure digital compliance via artificial intelligence and blockchain. In this interview, Arpit explains how he chose to embark on a career in FinTech after studying and practicing the law. India’s ever-growing FinTech landscape features a plethora of players – from incumbents to digital players to the government. With Signzy’s role as a data and technology-based enabler for financial services, Arpit provides valuable insights into the dynamics between various players as well as the role of data and regulations in the future of Indian FinTech. Amidst the economic and social challenges that have arisen from the current crisis, it has become even more important to evaluate how data and technology can enable various FinTech players without sacrificing the security of customers.\n \nEstablished in 2015, Signzy aims to build a global digital trust system with three components: (1) the ability to uniquely identify and authenticate entities, (2) the ability to access background information on these entities, and (3) the establishment of a system of rewards and punishments to reinforce trust. Today, Signzy offers a digital on-boarding solution for banks, NBFCs and other financial institutions. While most banking services in India are transitioning to digital, regulatory compliance remains largely offline and hampers consumer experience. Changing consumer preferences demand a shift to digital regulatory processes (including KYC or Know-Your-Customer), however moving to digital can expose higher risks. Signzy believes that through a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain, they can ensure that digital compliance is convenient yet secure.\n\nArpit studied and practiced law before founding this startup with his brother – and has ever since embarked on the journey to make digital financial services more secure and accessible through what he calls a global digital trust system. He co-founded Signzy in 2015 with his brother Ankit, who is currently the Head of Product. Along with the various accolades that Signzy has received for its innovative approach to solving regulation with data, Arpit himself has been recognized as Forbes 30 Under 30.",
