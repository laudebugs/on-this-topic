    "description": "Hosted by international garden design sensation Jamie Durie and featuring Chef Michel Nischan's James Beard award-winning \"Homegrown\" cooking segments, The Victory Garden equips viewers with the confidence and inspiration to roll up their sleeves, get their hands dirty, and live outdoors.\n\nWith so many Americans aspiring to care for the environment and create their own outdoor living spaces, The Victory Garden's unique fusion of garden design, earth-to-table cooking, and eco-conscious how-to tips is of greater interest today than ever before in its more than 30-year history. The newest season of The Victory Garden takes viewers on a coast-to-coast journey -- from a Napa Valley garden of fruits, vegetables, and herbs modeled after the 16th-century Jardins du Villandry in France, to a Massachusetts farm that provides pristine produce to some of the finest restaurants in Boston. \n\nThe Victory Garden is produced by WGBH Boston and distributed by PBS.
