            "description": "\n        <p>According to Merriam Webster, a “Friendship Feud” is when you have a big feud with your friend about whether it’s somehow a good thing that Stacey and Claudia are fighting and tearing apart the very fabric of the BSC, or whether it is, in fact, a bummer. This was not by any means a bummer of a book though, because it was elegantly and artfully written by the great Laura Dower, from the spectral realm where she lives. Anyway, the boys spend a lot of energy this week discussing Ann’s new ghostwriter, and they also find time for a nuanced and informative chat about the rules of rugby. It’s all very nice and fun, which is a lot more than we can say about the situation between Claud and Stace at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Music credits:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/sci-fi-trailer-DJSZBV2\" target=\"_blank\">“Sci-Fi Trailer,”</a> Ivan Luzan</p><p><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/parting-ways-UXAC94T\" target=\"_blank\">“Parting Ways,”</a> by Allen Grey&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://audiojungle.net/item/jazz-sad-hip-hop/18863902\" target=\"_blank\">“Jazz Sad Hip Hop,”</a> by Black Stone Sound</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjacI4ZR-OY\" target=\"_blank\">“Battle Area,”</a> by Fifty Vinc</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks as always to original Baby Boy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Lamb</a>&nbsp;for the intro music, and to&nbsp;Baby Bee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolfkiller\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfkiller</a>&nbsp;for the outro music.&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

Anyway, Kristy’s back having the idea for the Baby-Sitters Club again in this one and getting ready to do the whole thing all over again and it’s frankly pretty wonderful.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Music credits:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIviyUXLOoI\" target=\"_blank\">“Carnival Lament,”</a> by Robert Austin</p><p>The Theme to <em>Wii Sports</em> by Kazumi Totaka</p><p><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/uplifting-positive-techno-XPACS6J\" target=\"_blank\">“Uplifting Positive Techno,”</a> by Kornev Music</p><p><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/drama-EQAR8CZ\" target=\"_blank\">“Drama,”</a> by Clean Mind Soundz</p><p><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/sad-to-hopeful-49VN7PZ\" target=\"_blank\">“Sad to Hopeful,”</a> by The Story Shop</p><p><a href=\"https://audiojungle.net/item/jazz-sad-hip-hop/18863902\" target=\"_blank\">“Jazz Sad Hip Hop,”</a> by Black Stone Sound</p><p><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/sadness-RSZVYL3\" target=\"_blank\">“Sadness,”</a> by Allen Grey</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks as always to original Baby Boy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Lamb</a>&nbsp;for the intro music, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://superbrat.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Superbrat</a>&nbsp;for the outro music.&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

The Grey Man is here of course, and Tanner uses the dark arts of “Numberology” to solve the Ultimate Mystery, and Kristy and Cary Retlin are kidnapped by a literal gun criminal. What a way to go out!

Ignorance is bliss.” That’s right, there was arguably no mystery once again in this week’s Baby-Sitters Club Mystery book, much like how the film <em>Three Men and a Baby</em> is not a fun romp about three men raising a baby, but instead a gritty action film about drugs and the mafia, but we loved both regardless of how far they may have missed the mark.</p><p><br></p><p>Music Credits:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/comedy-pizzicato-WVMBNHS\" target=\"_blank\">“Comedy Pizzicato”</a> by lucafrancini</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/classic-arcade-video-game-6KMCVP9\" target=\"_blank\">“Classic Arcade Video Game”</a> by Adigold</li><li>“My Sharona” (MIDI Version) originally performed by the Knack</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/beat-box-1-LY6Z948\" target=\"_blank\">“Beat Box 1”</a> by HollywoodEdge</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/typewriter-blues-W54K2FQ\" target=\"_blank\">“Typewriter Blues”</a> by AllenGrey</li><li>“Building a Mystery” (Karaoke Version) originally performed by Sarah McLachlan</li><li>“Smoke Two Joints” (Karaoke Version) originally performed by Sublime</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/epic-patriotic-breakbeat-8D6AYLK\" target=\"_blank\">\"Epic Patriotic Breakbeat”</a> by StereoNuts</li><li>“Caress Me Down” (Karaoke Version) originally performed by Sublime</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/once-upon-a-dark-time-T394P6S\" target=\"_blank\">“Once Upon a Dark Time”</a> by AllenGrey</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/just-a-little-hope-TNEPUL4\" target=\"_blank\">“Just A Little Hope”</a> by Adigold</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/warmth-of-the-sun-BHEQWC7\" target=\"_blank\">“Warmth Of The Sun”</a> by Adigold</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/look-into-my-eyes-EKBGQS5\" target=\"_blank\">“Look Into My Eyes”</a> by AGsoundtrax</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/beautiful-darkness-SDEKAXU\" target=\"_blank\">“Beautiful Darkness” </a>by AllenGrey</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thanks to original <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Baby Boy Scott Lamb</a> for the intro music and <a href=\"http://www.bandcamp.com/superbrat\" target=\"_blank\">Superbrat</a> for the outro music.</p>\n      ",

So if you detect a hint of exuberance in the boys' voices this week it's either because this scintillating novel is a beautiful gift, or it’s not exuberance at all but incipient panic about the fact that we just found out for certain that ghosts are real. Sorry. Scare warning. Anyway, Claudia and Janine both have eyes for this hunk named Steve and ghosts are real and a boy died.

Listen to the our chorus of shrieks! “The whales!”, we shout, “the whales!” We also discuss alternate worlds, bug balls, how we pronounce the word “emu’ and we made the whole episode epistolary because we needed cover for the fact that Tanner’s co-working space was so full of people, so don’t be surprised if we hear from our friends Goliath and Mark Markson.</p><p><strong>Music Credits:</strong></p><ul><li>“Secret Agent Man” by Johnny Rivers</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/spooky-ident-2E6BHG4\" target=\"_blank\">“Spooky Ident”</a> by Allen Grey</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/scary-drone-3VS6B8U\" target=\"_blank\">“Scary Drone”</a> by Sound-Ideas</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/epic-superheroes-in-action-37CHN2E\" target=\"_blank\">“Epic Superheroes in Action”</a> by Marco Belloni Music</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/open-synthesizer-logo-KXC87FJ\" target=\"_blank\">“Open Synthesizer Logo”</a> by HollywoodEdge</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/mystic-digital-beeps-logo-2-XQJ45WV\" target=\"_blank\">“Mystic Digital Beeps Logo 2\"</a> by HollywoodEdge</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/classic-arcade-video-game-6KMCVP9\" target=\"_blank\">“Classic Arcade Video Game”</a> by Adigold</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/typewriter-blues-W54K2FQ\" target=\"_blank\">“Typewriter Blues” </a>by AllenGrey</li><li>“Mad World” (MIDI Version) originally performed by Gary Jules</li><li>“Building a Mystery” (Karaoke Version) originally performed by Sarah McLachlan</li><li>“Caress Me Down” (MIDI Version) originally performed by Sublime</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/dark-magic-Q69U34R\" target=\"_blank\">“Dark Magic”</a> by Allen Grey</li><li><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/beautiful-darkness-SDEKAXU\" target=\"_blank\">“Beautiful Darkness”</a> by AllenGrey</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thanks to original Baby Boy Scott Lamb for the intro music and to baby bee Jay for the outro music.</p>\n      ",

A lot. And Bib Fortuna. And there’s an ancient evil lurking deep in Stoneybrook’s past that is reaching out its tendrils through the clocks to collapse time and space and swallow the BSC in the nameless void.

Because they caught someone stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars red-handed! And instead of wondering what what the hell is on Joey’s head, they’re wondering if head’s will role when the Stoneybrook PD finally catches up to the bank heist bandit.

She just can’t help herself, she’s as drawn to crime as she is hot and horny young men, like Terry/David Hoyt/Hawthorne. This week, the girls solve a mystery, but like, an actual mystery. Who is trying to pass off counterfeit bills all over Stoneybrook? Is it the nefarious English teacher, Mr. Fisk? Is it Stacey’s new lover? Is it the savior of the Dunmer people and the hero of Morrowind, the Nerevarine?

Meanwhile, back in Stoneybrook, Mallory has alienated a potential client by mishandling a tantrum. Are these two crises treated with equal gravity and concern in this novel? Yes. Because this is the Baby-Sitters Club, and, frankly, Stacey is expendable. Fair warning: This one’s rated R, not just because of the helicopter carnage, but because there is a surprising amount of Arm Stuff, and some EXTREMELY enlightening new rules for the delicate dance known as Da Bonky.

It may just be part of her writing process for these Super Mysteries, in which case it worked! Plenty of spooky ghosts, scary vampires, and unsavory teenage boys in this one, not to mention a whole mess of parades, because Stoneybrook has finally gone fully off the deep end.

And the consequences of this return to the past – of this “recherche du temps perdu” – will be cataclysmic. A great storm is coming. A hurricane. A tempest of rage and hurt and remembrance that threatens to consume everything in its path. And with the darkness preceding the deluge come other dark things.

Listen in as your favorite podcast boys recreate that heady conversation, delving into Abby’s rotten attitude, Shannon Kilbourne’s confusing extracurricular activities, Jackie Rodowsky’s travels through the universe, and Claudia Kishi’s most daring outfit yet. And to make matters even more fascinating this week, Tanner loses a battle with peanut butter, and Jack learns how to do a knock-knock joke, so there’s plenty of good stuff to balance out Abby’s shoddy behavior.</p><p><br></p><p>Music credits:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://audiojungle.net/item/the-energetic-rock/21849194?s_rank=5\" target=\"_blank\">“The Energetic Rock,”</a> by InflectionPoint</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5c83Uixoj8\" target=\"_blank\">“Eternity,”</a> by Whitesand</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3akYklE6r7o\" target=\"_blank\">“Chopstick Slapstick,”</a> by OurMusicBox</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQIkHNvCs40\" target=\"_blank\">“Slash,”</a> by Arc North&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks as always to original Baby Boy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Lamb</a>&nbsp;for the intro music, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://superbrat.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Superbrat</a>&nbsp;for the outro music.&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

Which is exactly what our brave boys do this week, as they grapple with difficult truths like whether new baby-sitter Abby Stevenson is the best baby-sitter now that Dawn’s gone; whether it’s ever appropriate to question Kristy Thomas’s authority; and what, precisely, this all has to do with&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>. The bravest of the two boys also takes this opportunity to admit that he was wrong and to accept the consequences of his terrible mistake. Not to make excuses, not to ask for forgiveness – but to own what he has done and to pay for it. With his life. Also, there’s some good stuff about bees, Druscilla Destiny, and Abby’s burgeoning stand-up career, so strap in for a wild ride.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Music credits:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZlMr70G0-E\" target=\"_blank\">“Empty Promise,”</a> by UEMonthly</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOvbZKBJOQ4\" target=\"_blank\">“The Evil Carnival,”</a> by Robert Austin</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQogRILEkhA\" target=\"_blank\">“Drops of Jupiter remix,”</a> by Jesse Bloch</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIviyUXLOoI\" target=\"_blank\">“Carnival Lament,”</a> by Robert Austin</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSqqt-Pxsec\" target=\"_blank\">“Jane’s Lament,”</a> by EMSonora</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks as always to original Baby Boy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Lamb</a>&nbsp;for the intro music, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ByeByeEmpire/\" target=\"_blank\">Bye Bye Empire</a>&nbsp;for the outro music.&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

Sweet Pete also introduces an incredible new character called Abby Stevenson and she’s an instant favorite, but she comes with a LOT of baggage, and even though she claims to be from Long Island, her origin remains frighteningly unclear for the time being.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Music Credits:</strong></p><ul><li>“Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\"(Karaoke Version) originally performed by&nbsp;Eurythmics</li><li><a href=\"http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Stevies_Amp_Shack/~/noir_guitar\" target=\"_blank\">“Noir Guitar”</a> by Stevie’s Amp Shack</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVv3wU7Sn8c\" target=\"_blank\">\"Vanilla Summers”</a> by&nbsp;GRIID</li><li>\"I’ve Seen Better Days\"(Karaoke Version) originally performed by Citizen King</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thanks to original Baby Boy <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Lamb</a> for the intro music and <a href=\"http://www.bandcamp.com/superbrat\" target=\"_blank\">Superbrat</a> for the outro music.</p>\n      ",

            "description": "\n        <p>Get your tissues ready and put your crying hats on, Baby Nation, because this one’s a sad one! Set during the First World War, \"Farewell, Dawn\" follows the fortunes of the American paramedic Frederic Henry and an English nurse named Catherine Barkley. Against all odds, their love blossoms as the bombs and shrapnel explode around them, but they are ultimately doomed, not by the destruction and war where their love was born, but the quiet, aching stillness of solitude where it will eventually die. Actually, that MAY be the plot of Farewell to Arms, but it is very difficult to tell the difference between these two heartbreaking classics of American literature. Suffice it to say that Dawn is gone, and we’re just going to have to pick up the pieces and move on without her. At least Claudia was wearing something fun this week!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Music credits:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhZ-Ny-onfg\" target=\"_blank\">“Reversion,”</a> by Myuuji</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRIoo9eHvYg\" target=\"_blank\">“Don’t Leave Me,”</a>&nbsp;by Lionel Schmitt</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSqqt-Pxsec\" target=\"_blank\">“Jane’s Lament,”</a> by EMSonora</p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thelionhearts/overture-lionheart\" target=\"_blank\">“Overture,”</a> by Lionheart</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6bMW7d3tJo\" target=\"_blank\">“Supersonic,”</a> by Rob Gasser</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks as always to original Baby Boy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/scottlamb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Lamb</a>&nbsp;for the intro music, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://superbrat.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Superbrat</a>&nbsp;for the outro music.&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

There’s A LOT of singing. Too much singing. Sorry for all the singing. Stacey (with a soft ‘c’) or Stacey (with a hard ‘c’) (we’re not sure how it’s pronounced) has a run in with some bad girls who invite her into the seedy underworld of dingleberriness, and once it starts, the red, red wine never stops flowing.

            "description": "\n        <p>Babies and Gentlemen of the jury – over the course of this episode, we are going to present you with nothing but the facts of the case. You’re going to hear about Logan’s deceitful charm, about Alan Gray’s clever ruse, about the witches who walk among us in plain sight, and about William Blake’s critical analysis of <em>Paradise Lost</em>. And when all is said and done, when you have heard all that there is to hear, when the truth has been brought into the light, you are going to have no choice but to mete out justice according to the sacred laws of our great Nation of Babies. You are going to have no choice but to ACQUIT MARY ANNE SPIER OF ALL CHARGES. Because Mary Anne has broken no rules, Baby Nation!
