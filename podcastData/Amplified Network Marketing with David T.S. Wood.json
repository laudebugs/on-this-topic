            "datePublished": "Tue, 05 Apr 2016 21:00:13 +0000",
            "description": "Nat Cook is a 5-time Olympian - winning gold for her homeland of Australia at the Sydney Olympics. She’s no stranger to hard work, conviction, determination and believing you can. Nat spent 20 years as a professional volleyball player, becoming one of the most well-known players the sport has ever seen. She proudly takes her gold medal with her everywhere she goes - believing it was meant to be shared, touched, and appreciated. After volleyball, Nat was left with a question: what comes next? As you’ll hear in this inspiring interview with David, network marketing came next. For Nat, it was a natural transition from the world of competitive sports to network marketing. She shares what the transition was like, some key learnings, and what she loves most about the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"From Olympic Gold medalist to #NetworkMarketing guru, on this episode \"]\r\nWhy network marketing?\r\nWe’ve talked about the many misconceptions that exist about network marketing many times before. For Nat, she never really bought into that mindset. Even when she was playing volleyball, she recognized the value of network marketing and the world of possibilities the business opened up for those who work hard. And so, when an old friend started bringing a business opportunity to Nat, she eventually decided to give it a go. It was clear that many people have a negative perception about network marketing for one reason: it takes work. Nat shares her belief that too many of us today are about instant gratification and - well - that’s not what network marketing is. It takes hard work to succeed, but when you do you can succeed big time.\r\nHow do I make it better?\r\nNat shares the success of her mentor and friend who introduced her to the opportunity and why she believes their business has seen so much success. The key is being a leader. Nat shares why it’s important to lead with integrity and values, and to always focus on building a strong team. She discusses the financial success her friend has seen - in fact, the business she’s built with her husband is on track to make $1.5 million this year. Nat shares why she believes they’ve seen so much success - because they lead with their hearts and they are always present for the team.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"If it’s not getting easier, you’re doing something wrong, on this episode of Amplified #NetworkMarketing \"]\r\nIf it’s not getting easier, you’re doing something wrong.\r\nFor Nat, working hard comes naturally. But, after making a few mistakes in the beginning, Nat started to learn what works and what doesn’t work in building a successful business with a solid team. She goes on to share a key piece of advice she was told early on: if it’s not getting easier, you’re doing something wrong. This resonated with Nat for many reasons, but mostly because it became clear that the business isn’t hard. It takes hard work, but the systems required to build a successful business aren’t difficult to learn.\r\nBiggest learnings in the first year as a network marketer.\r\nIn the early days of her business, Nat and her partner went “all in”. Nat hit social media hard, cast a wide net, and started to attract loads of customers. The mistake? She wasn’t focusing on building a team, but was focused on selling products. In doing so, Nat was beginning to lose the authenticity of the business and - most importantly - the authenticity of herself. She gives insight into what she would do differently if she could go back and start over - including what is perhaps the most important thing: she would’ve said yes earlier. Nat is absolutely inspiring and open in sharing a glimpse into why she loves network marketing so much, as well as some key learnings that can help you build your own business.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"If you want what someone else has got, you’ve got to do what they do ~ Nat Cook\"]\r\nOUTLINE OF THIS GREAT EPISODE\r\n\r\n\t[0:36] David’s introduction of his guest, Nat Cook.\r\n\t[1:35] How does it feel to be recognized by people and to be a 5-time Olympian?",

            "datePublished": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 21:00:29 +0000",
            "description": "When Alexis Romano first heard about the network marketing opportunity, she - like many of us - was skeptical. As a high school counselor, Alexis was working 3 jobs to make ends meet - and was still barely making it work. She was constantly exhausted and was left with no time to enjoy her life because she was always working. Alexis craved a better life, but believed the only to create one was to work multiple jobs in order to have a better lifestyle. That’s when she heard about the opportunity from a friend. As Alexis shares the story of her journey into the network marketing business, she offers valuable insight into what works - and what doesn’t - if you’re ready to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"The only way to fail in this business is to quit, on this episode of Amplified #NetworkMarketing \"]\r\nOvercoming skepticism and understanding the opportunity.\r\nAt first, Alexis didn’t want to hear about the opportunity. She was interested in the products, but wasn’t ready to learn more about the business. One day, Alexis reluctantly agreed to have someone share the opportunity with her. She listened and wasn’t sure if it was for her. Alexis decided to go to an upcoming event just to see what it was all about - and that’s when things changed. This event opened her eyes to what was possible and left her with a feeling of “If they can do it, why can’t I?”\r\nThe millionaire mindset shift.\r\n5 years ago, when Alexis attended her first event, she was making about $3000 a month as a teacher, waitress, and tutor. When she took the plunge into the opportunity, she was able to replace her tutoring income in year 2, and would eventually retire from all jobs. Her income steadily grew and each year Alexis learned something new she could apply to her business to make it even more successful. She went from $7,000 to $13,000 to $25,000 to $64,000 to $900,000 in just 5 years. Today, Alexis is generating $100,000 a month from her network marketing business. A far cry from the $3k a month she was making from 3 jobs just a few short years ago.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"The #millionaire #mindset shift, on this episode of Amplified #NetworkMarketing \"]\r\nThe only way to fail is to quit.\r\nFor Alexis, it was important to learn each year in order to truly grow her business. In the beginning, she learned the value of having systems in place to make things run more efficiently. In year 2, she began to understand the influence of her mindset and realized it was time to make the shift to a millionaire mindset in order to pave the way for the life she wanted to create. Alexis grew to understand the value of personal development and investing in herself in order to take things to the next level. She shares the importance of affirmations in her journey and how they’ve helped to shape her life and her business.\r\nThe art of duplication.\r\nAs she closes out her chat with David, Alexis discusses her daily routine and how she maintains focus on the things that matter, while balancing it all. She makes personal development a part of her daily routine, which Alexis believes transformed not only her business, but also herself. She discusses the role of consistency in the business and shares why it’s all about the art of duplication. For Alexis, life today is a far cry from life 5 years ago. She has built a solid business and is well on her way to being a millionaire. Alexis offers insight into some steps she took to make it all happen and why it’s important to always invest in yourself first.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"#NetworkMarketing is all about the art of duplication, on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing. \"]\r\nOUTLINE OF THIS GREAT EPISODE\r\n\r\n\t[0:49] David’s introduction of his guest, Alexis Romano.\r\n\t[1:23] What Alexis did before taking the leap into network marketing.\r\n\t[2:30] What life was like when Alexis was working 3 jobs.\r\n\t[3:01] The feeling of just getting by.\r\n\t[3:43] How Alexis discovered the network marketing opportunity.\r\n\t[4:49] What made Alexis hesitate to jump on the opportunity when ...",

            "description": "Just over 3 years ago, Dawn Ferrentino - like many of us - was working hard and had little time left for her family. This busy mom worked 2 jobs in order to generate the income the family needed. As a professional accountant for 27 years, Dawn found herself maxed out at less than $100k per year and she was always stressed and overwhelmed. She knew something had to change. The network marketing business opportunity came into her life quite by accident, but from the beginning Dawn treated it like a business. With hard work, determination, and the ability to get out of her comfort zone, Dawn has been able to build a hugely successful business in just over 3 years. She shares with David how she’s managed to embrace network marketing as a business and what has made the difference in her journey thus far.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"How you can earn while you learn with #NetworkMarketing, on this episode\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an accountant, Dawn attended 4 years of school followed by the CPA exam. This investment in an education is essential for a traditional career like the one Dawn had prior to network marketing. She explains how she’s managed to generate her first million in just over 3 years in network marketing - earning while she learns the business. Dawn gives us insight into her approach to the business from the beginning and her willingness to fully immerse herself in the opportunity in order to see where it could take her. Even with resistance from people around her and with lots of “no’s”, Dawn persevered and managed to build a hugely successful business - and one that’s still growing.\r\nThe importance of meeting people where they are.\r\nOne of the toughest lessons for Dawn was realizing that this opportunity isn’t for everyone. She shares why it’s essential to meet people where they are - not where you are or where you think they should be. Understanding that this isn’t for everyone is a key ingredient to building a successful and happy team of network marketers. Dawn discusses how her income has grown - from 11k in her first year to 600k this year to her projection of 7 figures a year in just 3 years. She also shares how she grew her network from 5 people to a downline of 27,000 people in that time - after hearing no about 1000 times.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Why you need to meet people where they are, on this episode of Amplified #NetworkMarketing\"]\r\nThe path to 7 figures in network marketing.\r\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about network marketing, according to Dawn, is that it comes easy. She discusses the fact that it takes a lot of hard work and that’s why some people just aren’t cut out for the business. Dawn also shares what it was like at first, when her husband wasn’t quite sure that this could be a legitimate business and why she wishes she had done a better job of including her family in the journey from the start. Now - 3 years into it - her husband has retired and they have built a life that wouldn’t have been possible without network marketing.\r\nThe reward is the entire journey.\r\nFor Dawn, the reward isn’t just the money. She discusses what it’s like to work with a network marketing team and how they support each other along the way. Dawn also shares the value of personal development and why she focuses on making it a part of every single day. As David and Dawn finish out their chat, Dawn some key learnings and her advice for network marketers who are just starting out. Her story is inspiring and it’s clear that Dawn has embraced network marketing and quickly risen to the top of the industry. Her main message? If I can do it, you can too.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"The role of #PersonalDevelopment in a successful #NetworkMarketing career, on this episode\"]\r\nOUTLINE OF THIS GREAT EPISODE\r\n\r\n\t[1:01] David’s introduction of his guest, Dawn Ferrentino.\r\n\t[2:03] Dawn’s life before network marketing.\r\n\t[3:00] What was the maximum salary of her previous job?\r\n\t[4:43] Making her first million in 3 years as a network marketer.\r\n",

David has witnessed the integrity and true measure of Jim’s character by watching him when he thinks no one is paying attention. Along with wife, Kathy, Jim is a legend in the Network Marketing arena. Jim is president and CEO for Isagenix, a billion dollar company the couple came out of retirement to co-found. Jim is a wealthy and successful businessman who could be sprawled out in a hammock somewhere on a private island. Instead, Jim remains in the trenches, pursuing results in people’s lives and global change in health and wellness. His company offers the opportunity and vehicle for people to transform their lives. Today’s conversation focuses on the story behind the success, as well as turning points along the way. No matter your circumstances, make the choice today to change your life and pursue success. This episode of Amplified Network Marketing offers inspiration you won’t want to miss.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"President and CEO of Isagenix, Jim Coover\"]\r\nPossibility and responsibility\r\nWhen Jim wakes up in the morning, his thoughts are often of possibility and responsibility. He sees life as an opportunity to write his own story. He lives each day with the intention to be the best he can be and to positively influence as many people as he can. There are a lot of people looking to him to look after the enterprise and he takes his responsibilities seriously. Of course, the load is shared, but Jim feels a deep sense of commitment to the whole company. Circumstances presented themselves and Jim came out of retirement to realize an opportunity to impact world health. He believed he had a vehicle to realize his vision and took the necessary risks. Along the way, there were struggles and naysayers. Jim was deeply committed to getting his company’s ideas into the marketplace and into people’s lives. Integrity and trust were big lessons Jim learned, which are now evident in his relationship with his wife and family. They each bring greatness and skills to the business and their relationship. This couple, despite their success and humble beginnings, never limited their impact. Listen in to unleash your own possibility of impact. \r\nThe early years\r\nGrowing up, Jim thought of himself as a “little guy.” He was a little brother and two years younger than most of his classmates. Since he was younger and smaller, competing athletically was a challenge. He was introduced to bodybuilding his senior year, which became a defining moment and realization that he was engaged in attainable transformation if he worked for it. Jim no longer thought he was destined to be small. He got excited, saw results, and recognized that he could be in control. During his time working out at the gym, Jim noticed what professions allowed people to work out whenever they wanted. He decided to learn to cut hair to support himself and keep up his fitness routine. Jim was paid on commission, so his earnings were tied to personal performance and relationships with people. He gained confidence and made connections as his paradigm shifted into building a business by offering a unique service. He took up men’s hair styling, incorporating the sale of products for men to upkeep their new looks. Hear the whole story of Jim’s successful launch into the fitness industry on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.  \r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Finding your vision and vehicle, with Jim Coover\"]\r\nTransformation and traps\r\nJim is familiar with a whole gamut of struggles in health and fitness. When he was small he struggled to gain weight, and then gained too much weight, too quickly. He remembers the way people looked at him differently and can identify with people who struggle with their weight. He knows the physical and the emotional suffering that often accompanies the struggles. Jim is now in the business of transforming people’s lives by transforming their health.

            "datePublished": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 22:00:46 +0000",
            "description": "Today’s guest, Sarah Rowan Dahl, is a performance painter. Sarah is established and experienced in this unique, creative outlet in the entertainment industry. She seeks not only to entertain, but also to inspire. Sarah brings a creative work of art to life in front of people in a live setting. Often she enhances the performance by painting to music, allowing the tones, notes and sounds to create the colors on the canvas. It is really Sarah’s quirky personality that connects with the audience and adds the buzz of energy that draws a crowd. Sarah performs for various types of events and functions, from the corporate setting, to festivals, fundraisers, weddings, and zoos. Sarah believes creativity is innate in us all and strives to awaken it in people who have forgotten how. Her courage has pushed the limits in performance art and the platform it establishes. Listen to the conversation with David T.S. Wood to be inspired and motivated to rediscover your own creativity.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"“We have an innate desire to create.” ~ Sarah Rowan Dahl\"]\r\nA platform for the voiceless.\r\nSarah uses her talent and work to raise awareness and funds for charities, such as The A21 Campaign, focused on ending human trafficking. Frequently, her performance pieces from functions will be auctioned off for charity. Sarah may not have the money in her pocket to donate much to these organizations, but her paintings inspire others to give. Human trafficking is the primary cause that Sarah donates to. Organizations like A21 work against the perpetrators that find families in dior circumstances, buy their children off of them, and either work them in an underground industry, rape them, sell them, or all of the above. This is a global crisis Sarah cannot ignore, especially as a mother of two young daughters. It might make people uncomfortable, but it is something Sarah says we should be uncomfortable about. She is a freedom fighter, able to use art as a platform and tool to raise money and awareness for such a great cause. You’ll want to hear this one.\r\nArt bypasses age, cultural, and language barriers for a global impact. \r\nSarah’s creativity started with doodling. She was on a basketball scholarship in college and went to Brazil to teach kids basketball. Sarah, not knowing the language very well, used doodling  to communicate with the kids. She realized that art was a way to bypass cultural and language barriers. She wanted to inspire people globally and found a breakthrough in art. Art crossed bridges and equalized people from all over the world. Soon, Sarah found herself going after a BFA, studying to be an artist. The move to performance art came because no one teaches how to make a living at art. Historically, students pursuing art have a lot of jobs. Sarah, like most of her classmates, took up waitressing. One day, she decided she would either do what she loved, or starve trying. Sarah started an art business, combining her love of art and using it to communicate and entertain across barriers. About half of Sarah’s current performances are improvised. She does more mental prep than actual paint planning. Her courage is contagious and will have you pulling out a paintbrush by the end of the episode.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"“Have a go, ya mug.” ~ Sarah Rowan Dahl’s Australian inspiration.\"]\r\nAddressing the result of devaluing art and creativity. \r\n \r\n\r\nWhy do so many people opt out of creativity? Why is it dismissed in the corporate world or silenced in adults? Sarah says that there has been a recent embrace of the arts that was missing since the rise of the Industrial Revolution. There was not an artistic encouragement to most people’s lives and the fear of fitting in or gaining approval silenced so many. Sarah’s mission is to inspire people to get rid of those inner fears holding them back. If you just try, you might find that you actually can be creative. Sarah understands the mocking of a blank canvas and is her own worst critic.",

            "description": "The 2007 economic crash interrupted Las Vegas in every way possible. The second largest economic influence, the construction industry, came to a halt. JoJo and Vinnie Bennington felt the halt as devastation hit their bank account. Vinnie, a retired Marine, was working as an electrician in Las Vegas. His last big project ended and he was out of work. His wife, JoJo, was three years into her Network Marketing business. Although Vinnie knew about his wife’s pursuit, he had no idea she was keeping them afloat with her earnings. Prior to Network Marketing, JoJo was a blackjack dealer. She left that profession, hoping to find freedom through owning her own business. She built three tanning salons from the ground up, but found the opposite of freedom. JoJo’s introduction to Network Marketing came through product use and grew into an accidental paycheck. As she toyed with the ideal of Network Marketing full-time, Vinnie voiced his opposition. JoJo’s journey of perseverance meets Vinnie’s skepticism to create a story of success in relationship and in business. Listen in to the conversation with David T.S. Wood to be inspired and motivated whether you are the skeptic or the one unable to find support.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Addressing the skeptics, on this episode of #AmplifedNetworkMarketing.\"]\r\nThe traditional mindset as a deterrent. \r\nVinnie’s mindset of what it meant to be a man was built as a boy and reinforced as a Marine. When he ran out of work because of the economic crash, he held onto the belief of one day returning to work and continuing to provide for his family. Vinnie held onto this hope while collecting unemployment, but then the unemployment ran out. Vinnie was depressed, feeling lost and like a failure. He gained weight and spent his days sitting on the couch with no identity. Vinnie was under the impression the family was staying afloat from their savings, when in reality JoJo’s Network Marketing business was steadily growing. She paid off their car and debt while Vinnie was sitting on the couch, hoping his traditional job and role would resurface. You are going to want to hear how one wife persevered and one husband changed his mind, on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\nLiving in resistance and non-support.\r\nFor JoJo, the economy crash wiped out the income that was keeping them comfortable. She had seen what was possible in Network Marketing and just started really working on her business. When she initially told Vinnie she was going to sell her three tanning salons and pursue Network Marketing, he thought she was crazy. He thought the entire industry was sketchy and full of used-car salesmen. Some days it was an argument, some days a push. JoJo knew she was on the right path, even though there was no support from her husband. When construction tanked and Vinnie was out of work and lost as a man, JoJo dared him to redefine himself. She would ask Vinnie to join her about every three months, but he did not believe in Network Marketing, trust it, or want anything to do with it. JoJo kept increasing her connections, upping her marketing strategies, and securing residual income. It was difficult for her to see Vinnie in such a dark place. She revealed that she had doubled her income, freed them up, replaced his income, and paid off debt. Get an inside view of a real couple’s marriage and their struggle to come together in the midst of hardship.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"“I thought they were all used-car salesmen.” ~ Vinnie Bennington\"]\r\nA revelation and exit from exile.\r\nVinnie’s resistance was real and fierce. His stigma of Network Marketers blocked his ability to see it as a real profession or respect it in any way. When JoJo took Vinnie with her to Belize for a work trip, he was surrounded by Network Marketers. Even host, David T.S. Wood, was met with Vinnie’s resistance. Vinnie slowly started to see that they were not used car salesmen. He found out they all had traditional jobs at one point and were not much different than he was.",

            "datePublished": "Tue, 09 Feb 2016 22:00:04 +0000",
            "description": "Adam and Michelle Carey have made plenty of mistakes as Network Marketers. They dove into this profession unprepared as young twenty-somethings, but learned to harness their passion and approach their business with etiquette and integrity. Adam and Michelle found they were not alone in learning the ropes the hard way. They decided the gap in etiquette training needed to be addressed if the industry hoped to gain momentum and be respected as a profession. There is a shift happening today, away from old approaches to business and towards Network Marketing. The Carey’s mission is to add some manners to that momentum. They aim to accelerate success, alleviate rejection, and elevate Network Marketing as a profession. They speak as seasoned ambassadors, with the desire to see unity among Network Marketers. Adam and Michelle believe the industry will boom if professionals come together, not to recruit one other, but to support each other. Listen in to this etiquette training episode to stay classy as a Network Marketer.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Accelerate your success with proper etiquette, on this episode.\"]\r\nPersonal growth is as important to Network Marketing as food and water are to your survival.\r\nFrom the inception of Network Marketing as a profession, it has offered a different path than that of traditional business. People have developed freedom for themselves and exploded their personal growth. Network Marketers are able to grow into themselves and then grow their income. Adam Carey advises that neglecting personal growth inhibits any chance you have to make it in this industry. Michelle Carey adds that the entire profession is built to help people grow. The couple gets most fired up about seeing that growth and character development in their team members. They believe in this industry so fiercely because it has made them better individuals, spouses, business owners, and now parents. Their desire for themselves as well as their team, is for no one to stop growing. They help people, help people. Give a listen to the Carey’s daily method of operating and the areas of growth they emphasize. \r\nComparison is a cancer in the Network Marketing industry.\r\nThe biggest hindrance to your own success might just be you. Adam points out that the spirit of comparison trapped him early on in his career. The industry exposed him to leaders and people who successfully reached the highest ranks with seemingly no hindrances.  When he came across his own struggles and obstacles, it was tempting to think he did not measure up.  This can hinder anybody’s growth and distort perspective. But comparison did not serve Adam and it will not serve you. Embrace the inspiration available, but stay on your own journey. Your trials produce perseverance and authenticity. As a team leader, Adam is now able to relate to doubts and fears of his team members. The mission behind the Adam and Michelle’s movement is learning from mistakes they made. They are still on their journey, and it is one that elevates the profession as a whole, not their status. Adam says comparison can lead to cannibalising each other, which destroys the industry from the inside out. Learn how to hold yourself and your team to a high standard on this episode of Network Marketing. \r\n\r\n[Tweet \"The new rebellion is freedom.\"]\r\nAddressing etiquette to eliminate stigmas. \r\nAre you a defensive tackler?  Or a motor mouth?  Negative Nancy?  Poor-me Paul? Do you “bait and slam” people you are attempting to recruit? Adam and Michelle have labeled these common blunders to help you identify your areas of weakness.  Michelle, who used to be a “defensive tackler,” shares stories of mistakes she made early on in her attempts to defend her belief in the Network Marketing industry. People would say, “Is this just a pyramid scheme” and she would unleash fury on them.  Her defensive reaction closed people off and perpetuated misunderstandings of what Network Marketing really is.",

            "description": "Today, Tracy O’Malley is an admired and respected network marketing team leader.  It would be easy to dismiss her success as unattainable for the average professional pursuing network marketing - unless you hear how her story began.  A few years back, Tracy found herself in the chaotic crisis of dealing with divorce, being a single mother, the sudden death of a parent, and the insufficient income to keep a roof over her head.  Listen in as Tracy openly invites us into her past life of negativity, unhealthy coping mechanisms, and checking herself into rehab. Her authentic struggle to overcome personally and professionally is relatable no matter what your rock bottom looks like. You will be inspired by Tracy’s honest and brave story of choosing to change her life.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Tracy O’Malley-the story behind the success\"]\r\nCrisis as a catalyst for beginning a network marketing profession \r\nSometimes it takes a crisis to propel us forward to where we could and should be.  Had Tracy O’Malley not reached the bottom, she might never have found the gumption to fight to the top.  Life at the bottom was broken, which led to being broke, which led to coping mechanisms that landed her in rehab. It took facing rehab for Tracy to trust wise counsel, and be open to opportunities.  A network marketing option fell into her lap when she was actually willing to try something different, anything different.  Tracy committed to an intimidating beginning, grew her business exponentially, and is passionate about bringing people alongside her in her success.  It is a story that will breathe bravery into you.\r\nNetwork Marketing gains credibility by taking off your masks\r\nWhat kind of masks do you wear? How do you present yourself in social situations and on social media? Tracy has found that authenticity sells itself.  She went from realizing she was surrounded by jerks and was the biggest jerk of them all, to creating a powerful following both on social media and in her network marketing company. Tracy credits taking off the masks she wore for years to her success.  It is hard work releasing the expectations of others, but it left Tracy with the discovery of her true passion and purpose.  Hear how she faced her fears, and let go of caring what other people thought to grow herself, her team, and her business.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Taking off the masks in #NetworkMarketing\"] \r\nCreating freedom and the first steps toward success\r\nTaking a step towards change came at the bottom of the bottom for Tracy.  But how did she find that determination and belief that life could be different and better for her and her family? Tracy knew she wanted the financial ability to uproot herself the next time her presence was needed in a crisis. She knew that network marketing provided that ability - she could continue working to build her empire and be present for her kids, her aging mom, and the things that really matter at the end of the day. Tracy’s journey demonstrates that network marketing creates momentum that not even the inconveniences of life can slow down.  This episode of Amplified Network Marketing aids in identifying your hurdles and leaping over them. \r\nFollow the leaders to become a leader \r\nTracy is a self-proclaimed rule breaker that doesn’t like being told what to do. But to make it through rehab and onto the right road, she listened to her sponsor, gleaned valuable knowledge from mentors and pursued leaders who had gone before. Listen to her “tough love” advice about following in her footsteps, learning from the mistakes of others, and deciding if you want to be a dabbler and get dabbler’s results or if you are committed to the process that leads to success.  Tracy knows it is all about building relationships and being able to connect to a community that works together.  Hear how you can join in, on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"“When I found my passion, it led me right to my purpose” ~ Tracy O’Malley\"]\r\nOUTLINE OF THIS GREAT EPISODE\r\n\r\n",

            "description": "The Amplified Network Marketing show is all about passive and residual income streams… not only through the vehicle of Network Marketing. The reason is simple: Network Marketers know a good residual income opportunity when they see one and are always looking for ways to diversify their income through multiple income streams. Today’s guest, Matt Miller, has created a hugely successful vending company that provides the kind of residual and passive income that hits the bullseye, and David wanted to expose you to his opportunity to see if it’s a good fit for you.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"An inspiring story of building residual income and a successful business, with Matt Miller\"]\r\nAn influential book and a bold step into another world.\r\nMatt was exposed to Robert Kiyosaki’s book, “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” years ago, and totally bought into his philosophy of building passive and residual income streams. But he’d failed to truly act on it for years. When a friend at his church approached him about a business opportunity involving vending machines, Matt’s thoughts about Robert’s book came back to him and he immediately saw the opportunity he’d been waiting for. He jumped in with both feet and has progressed way beyond simply having a few machines in businesses. He’s built his own franchise opportunity that families all over North America are using to build their own passive and residual income streams. Find out more on this episode.\r\nIf you’re business is going to thrive, you’ve got to be bold enough to knock on doors.\r\nIt doesn’t matter how ingenious of an opportunity you find to make passive income, if you’re unwilling to step outside your comfort zone and do what it takes to get customers, you’ll waste the opportunity. Matt Miller learned that when he got into the vending business and started knocking on the doors of decision makers at local schools to place his vending machines. Many doors were closed in his face, other administrators were kind but rejected the idea. But he kept asking, he kept knocking, and over time he found the customers that he knew would enable his business to grow and thrive. You can hear Matt’s story of perseverance and success on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Stepping into a bold new world of passive and residual income, with Matt Miller\r\nPartnering with schools for profit and charity.\r\nMatt Miller decided to work with schools because he saw an opportunity to prosper his business and benefit the schools through fundraisers at the same time. These partnerships are enabling the schools to earn money for their programs and needs, the students and opportunity to build resources for their own education, and Matt’s company the resources they need not only to make a profit, but also to build the company and help more schools. It’s a win-win situation that generates passive income and ongoing revenue for the schools.

The cost of owning a franchise is very small compared to typical franchise opportunities, the passive income potential is real, and the opportunity for families to do the business together is part of the philosophy the company promotes.

            "description": "There are many ways you can use the money you make through your network marketing to increase your overall cashflow and build wealth over the long term. It doesn’t all have to happen through the business activities of you and your team. One of David’s favorite ways to build wealth is through real estate. On today’s show, David is chatting with Kira Golden McClellan and Matthew McClellan, of Direct Source Wealth. The two of them run a company that builds investment opportunities in real estate that many types of people can come into to co-invest, build wealth together, and see their income grow. You’ll find lots of gems from this episode, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Would you like to learn about co-investing in #RealEstate? - Find out how on this episode\"]\r\nWhat does it mean to co-invest in real estate?\r\nCo-investing makes it possible for a number of investors who each have smaller amounts to invest, to go in on a project together to own varying portions of the project. The co-investment company oversees the project and the timelines, and investors receive their profits once the project is completed. It’s a win-win situation for the co-investment company and for the individual investors, enabling everyone to gain income through the improvement of properties and the ownership of real estate. Kira and Matthew have a great deal of expertise in this area and you’ll feel very comfortable with them and their approach to real estate investing. Be sure to listen.\r\nBuilding trust in a real estate partnership is vital to the long term profitability of the venture.\r\nReal estate investment partnerships are very much like any other relationship, it’s founded on a basis of trust. If you don’t feel that the other investors or the managers of the project you’re investing in, are trustworthy, you’re going to be wind up being stressed and worried about the money you have invested in a given project. That’s why the team at Direct Source Wealth has created such a substantial portfolio of successful projects and makes their credibility a source of open knowledge to their investors. They want every investor who works with them to feel entirely comfortable that they can be trusted. Find out about their unique approach to the world of real estate investing, on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\nDo you have the right long-term mindset for co-investing?\r\nFor a co-investing strategy to be beneficial to everyone involved, the investors need to have similar philosophies about the time frames involved in the investment. Many projects are long-term, requiring the initial investment for a longer period of time and paying dividends or profits periodically through the term of the project (like an apartment building that is purchased). Investors who feel they might need their entire amount returned before a project is sold would not fit well into a situation like that. You can learn more about co-investing and the mindsets that can make you a successful co-investing partner by listening to this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"What should you do with the amazing income your #NetworkMarketing provides?

But they also build contingency plans into every project to ensure that investor’s money is being used in ways that will still gain them a return should markets dramatically change.

            "description": "No matter what you’ve heard about network marketing, it’s hard to argue with the success that many, many people have seen through the industry. Gone are the days of pyramid schemes and front-loaded companies. Today, technology is making it possible for people who truly desire to succeed and work hard to make their fortunes through helping each other via the vehicle of network marketing. Jimmy Smith is an example of that kind of determination. In this episode you’re going to hear how he left a 40 year career at age 62, and within 8 years was making over $30 million a year. It’s an amazing story with lots of ups and downs, so be sure you take some time to listen.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"He didn’t start his business until age 62, and now makes $30 mil a year\"]\r\nHe saw the math immediately, then went searching for a company worth his time.\r\nJimmy Smith knew that network marketing would be his vehicle to wealth the moment he understood how the math worked. In his mind it was the most beautiful and perfect form of democracy in existence. But his family and friends didn’t see it right away. His first ventures were not successful because of companies that he couldn’t fully support and he lost a lot of money. But as he continued to search for the company that he could support, he never lost faith in the network marketing model. In this episode you’ll hear Jimmy’s amazing story and why he believes that network marketing is THE avenue for anyone who wants to work hard for their success.\r\nHow do you carry on when your family thinks you’re crazy?\r\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that Jimmy Smith’s family was skeptical of his network marketing obsession at first. After a bankruptcy and losing a lot of money, his wife didn’t think he knew what he was talking about when he spoke of network marketing in glowing terms. But Jimmy didn’t lose faith, even though he was tempted to quit many times. He knew that the process would work if he could just find the right system and company - which he finally did. Hear how Jimmy pushed through the times of discouragement and eventually won over his wife and family, on this episode of Crank It Up.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"How he kept going after bankruptcy and a family that called him crazy, on this episode\"]\r\nIf you teach a man to teach others to fish, you can feed the whole world.\r\nFor Jimmy Smith, it’s not enough to teach people how to make their own millions. He wants to teach people how to teach others to make millions and pass that information along as much as possible. It’s part of the way he views the power and vehicle of network marketing that makes him so effective. He truly wants to see people succeed because of what that success can do for their family line and legacy. Jimmy shares his story on this episode and discusses how the network marketing industry has changed over the years, and how he sees it poised for a huge resurgence and growth curve in the coming years.\r\nAt 87 years old, where does the energy and passion come from?\r\nFor Jimmy Smith, it comes from being convinced that what he’s doing is important and will last. He’s able to pass on a legacy through his family that he never knew was possible, and through his network marketing organization he’s seeing people’s lives changed every day. There is so much good he’s able to do, and it drives him to keep going every day when he wakes. This episode is encouraging, inspiring, and powerful, so be sure you take the time to listen to this seasoned businessman and professional people helper.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"From butcher to network marketing millionaire, on this episode\"]\r\nOutline of this great episode\r\n\r\n\tJimmy Smith’s journey into Network Marketing at age 62.\r\n\tThe early challenges Jimmy faced as he started his Network Marketing company.\r\n\tThe stress the first 5 years were for Jimmy and how he overcome it.\r\n\tThe conversation Jimmy had with his bankruptcy attorney about Network Marketing.\r\n\tWhat Jimmy saw in the industry that kept him from quitting when times were hard and failure ...",

            "description": "If anyone can talk about having a “past” and the battle it is to fight your way out of depression, it’s Chris Atkinson. Chris was a teenager when he began to feel the tone of his life sliding south. He began drinking and drug use when he was a preteen and by the time he was in High School he had checked out of life. His slide took him a long way down and it was years before light began to dawn on him. But it wasn’t a spontaneous thing, it was something that had to come from within him as he began listening to the voices around him, the people who were telling him that his life could be different… and that he had the choice to make it that way. On this episode of Amplified Network Marketing you’re going to hear Chris’ powerful story of jail time, drug and alcohol addiction, and the turnaround he’s made to become a multimillionaire in the Network Marketing industry.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"It’s never too late, with Chris Atkinson on this episode of Amplified #NetworkMarketing\"\r\nDo you sometimes feel like life should be “more”?\r\nChris Atkinson definitely felt that way from a young age but was convinced by the time he was in his teen years that it was just a dream that could never come true. His struggles are evidence that no matter how far you’ve sunk in life, it’s never too late. That’s the primary message Chris and his wife teach to those they mentor. You can make a change at any point on your journey. The difference is made on the level of attitude and belief. On this episode Chris describes the turning point that happened in his life and how Network Marketing played a pivotal role. He also describes the wide-reaching impact it has had not only on his income and business, but on his personal relationships as well.\r\nThe life you dream about is possible. \r\nChris and Debbie Atkinson have taught thousands of people just like you that it’s never too late to turn things around so you can have the life you desire. On this episode Chris highlights the beginning steps you need to take in order to begin that change. He talks about why you have to dream BIG, the importance of setting goals, how to flip the switch from scarcity to abundance, the power of persistence, and why gratitude is the key to a prosperous life. You’ll hear Chris’ personal story woven into everything so be sure you listen to what has happened in this amazing man’s life.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"You MUST dream big if you want to see your life change ~ Chris Atkinson\"]\r\nI was finally sick of letting life slip through my fingers.\r\nDrinking and drugging his life away became a sickening thing to Chris Atkinson, and when he decided that he wasn’t going to allow his life to slip away like that, things began to change. Through the help of 12 step programs, supportive parents, and a network marketing company that focused on personal development, Chris made quick advances toward becoming a successful businessman and a husband and father with a new lease on life. You can make those same kinds of changes, and Chris is on the Amplified Network Marketing show to teach you how. Be sure to listen!\r\nRelationships change just as dramatically as the finances.\r\nChris Atkinson believes that your finances and business success can’t reach new levels until you reach those levels in your personal life. You’ve got to change in order for your life to change. As he began living out that philosophy he was able to rebuild a relationship with his son that had been nonexistent to that point. Now, he and his son are the best of friends and rejoice in the progress and triumphs the other experiences. You can hear more of this heart-warming story on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing, and learn how the personal development focus of his MLM team enabled Chris to take the steps he needed to take in order for it to happen.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"You can make your life different if you are willing to become different ~ Chris Atkinson\"]\r\nOUTLINE OF THIS GREAT EPISODE\r\n\r\n\t[0:40] David’s introduction of his guest today,",

            "datePublished": "Tue, 01 Dec 2015 22:00:35 +0000",
            "description": "What will you be doing when you’re 74 years old? How will you be feeling about life? Ready to settle down? Ready to rest, relax, slow down a bit? Those thoughts are completely foreign to today’s guest, Eric J. Smetherhamn. It was only four years ago that Eric began his network marketing career after already being retired from his own small business for a number of years. His new business has created a new life that he finds hard to believe and it has given him a new zest for life that has powerfully impacted the way he lives every day. On this episode you’re going to hear Eric’s story, how his success has come about, and how he proves that network marketing is no respecter of age.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Age is just a number. How #NetworkMarketing energizes a 74 year old\"]\r\nWhat is a “professional network marketer?”\r\nThat’s what Eric J. Smetherhamn says when people ask him what he does. He sees it as a way of saying that he’s serious about his business and wants to do it in a professional way. What he’s most excited about is that he has the opportunity to use his years of experience as a small business owner and his more recent experience in network marketing to coach and empower people to live extraordinary lives and achieve time and financial freedom. It’s something he’s passionate about, which you’ll hear in this conversation he had with David T.S. Wood.\r\nNetwork Marketing is a personal development business, even for the older set.\r\nAT 74 years old it would make total sense if Eric J. Smetherhamn saw himself as being beyond the point of taking on new personal challenges. But his entrance into network marketing has stimulated a desire to learn and grow on a daily basis. He’s quick to ask questions, learn new strategies for personal growth and mindset change, and maximize his potential as a person - just as much as he is for his business. He doesn’t see age as a factor at all. Young and old alike are responsible to make the most of their life - which is exactly what he’s doing. His story is an inspiration so make sure you take the time to hear it on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Build a #LifestyleBusiness that fulfills your dreams. Hear Eric’s story on this episode\"]\r\nWhy would a 74 year old seek out the advice of 25 year olds?\r\nIf you ask Eric J. Smetherhamn that question (he’s 74, by the way) he’d tell you it’s because he’s not through with life yet. There’s lots more to experience and lots more to achieve. He knows that things today are very different than when he owned his small business years ago. He knows that the world operates according to different principles, so he inquires of those who are right at the heart of those changes - the younger set. His testimony is that once he learned the language and interests of those in their 20s and 30s, his ability to talk with them on a level of understanding about the opportunities that network marketing provides increased, and his business success began to take off. You’ll get a lot out of what Eric has to share, to be sure to listen to this episode.\r\nWhat will you be doing when you’re 74 years old?\r\nIt’s really up to you, isn’t it? Eric J. Smetherhamn would be first to tell you that age doesn’t have to slow you down. He’s living a life that he could only dream of prior to entering the ranks of professional network marketers and he is working hard to encourage others to build a similar life of freedom and time for themselves. What are your dreams? What are you capable of doing? Eric wants you to know that you can accomplish it all, no matter your age. Find out how he’s done it and how you can move in the same direction, on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing with David T.S. Wood.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"Young or old, #NetworkMarketing can set you up for the life of your dreams\"]\r\nOUTLINE OF THIS GREAT EPISODE\r\n\r\n\t[0:31] David’s introduction to the show and why he’s in love with Network Marketing.\r\n\t[0:59] Who is Eric Smetherhamn?\r\n",

            "datePublished": "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 22:00:17 +0000",
            "description": "In 2012, Christine Burke’s husband Stacey was approached about considering a network marketing company. Although they were both very skeptical at first they experienced amazing results. A few months later, Christine and Stacey decided that the financial challenges that they had experienced needed some immediate solutions and started to look at network marketing as a way to earn income. What started as something she pursued largely on her own soon turned into a joint effort. Christine and her husband Stacey are building a great Network Marketing business together, and not only do they absolutely love building teams of people, but are finding the 'magic' of the company they are working with - the leadership, the products, the compensation plan, the support - something that they never want to live without. Listen to the conversation with David T.S. Wood to be inspired and motivated to accomplish similar dreams for yourself.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"The Amplified #NetworkMarketing podcast with David T.S. Wood is back on the air!\"]\r\nFrom dependent housewife to determined money maker\r\nChristine Burke was a typical woman, staying home with her kids, supporting her husband’s career as a chiropractor, living happily in her own little world. There’s nothing wrong with any of that except that she came across an opportunity that enabled her to discover that in addition to those marvelous things, she was able to accomplish even more. That opportunity was network marketing. In this conversation you’re going to hear how Christine took the leap into the unknown by joining a NM company, how it grew substantially, and how her personal growth has now inspired her husband to step out of his established practice and join her in the business. It’s an inspiring story of what is possible in the lives of ordinary people. You’ll want to hear this one.\r\nLeaving his established chiropractic practice to become a network marketer. \r\nStacey Burke is the kind of chiropractor his patients love. His energy and enthusiasm about his patients makes them loyal and devoted to him as a provider. It’s that same energy that causes his wife Christine to believe that he’d be wonderful at helping her build a thriving network marketing business.  When he began to see the huge success Christine was having he began to look beyond the 9 to 5 workday and into the realm of possibility. The two of them began to dream, to pull closer to each other, and to grow together in life and in business. Their story shows that network marketing is a unique business model, one that enables couples to do what they thought was impossible and grow closer and more free all at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Tweet \"How I’m showing up in my own life is a new thing ~ Christine Burke\"]\r\nNetwork Marketing businesses are multiplied through personal growth\r\nChristine Burke discovered that one of the ways that her business team has been able to grow the most is when she leads the way in growing personally. Her growth stimulates the growth of her team, both in terms of business skills and in their own personal journey. That multiplies back and forth all over the organization. To that end she ensures that every year she involves herself in an event or opportunity for personal growth that pushes her to become more than she’s ever been before. Hear how she goes about it and the amazing doors personal growth has opened for her and for her business team, on this episode of Amplified Network Marketing.\r\nNetwork Marketing is a breeding ground for leaders.\r\nWoven into the DNA of network marketing is team building. The drive to become successful is fueled by the need to help others on your team be successful. That’s a recipe for success all the way around but it’s also the way that people grow in their leadership abilities for the sake of the people in the organization. Every member of a team learns to care for others and help them succeed, which in turn causes the entire network to thrive.",

Those of you who tuned in last week, heard David share a very private and emotional moment, when he discovered that his son had started to lie to him. Today David shares more about how they managed to resolve the problem. Ben tells us about a book that he read to better understand the situation, and improve himself and his life.\r\n\r\nThe book is called \"The Four Agreements\" by Don Miguel Ruiz. It is a practical guide to personal freedom; it is about 4 agreements that you need to make with yourself to live a better and happier life. The 4 agreements are:\r\n\r\n1) Be impeccable with your word: First with yourself, and then with others.\r\n2) Don't take anything personally.\r\n3) Don't make assumptions.\r\n4) Always do your best.\r\n\r\nDavid takes Ben through these agreements and asks what he thinks they mean. Ben's most important take away from this book was: Always tell the truth, no matter what. That sounds like something we've been hearing from David himself for quite a while: \"Tell the truth all the time with compassion.\" :)\r\n\r\nSongs:\r\nKiller Queen by Queen\r\nCrazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen\r\nI Want To Break Free by Queen\r\nAnother One Bites The Dust by Queen\r\n\r\nBooks:\r\nThe Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz\r\nThe Speed of Trust by Stephen Covey",

Today, David's guests are David & Angelike Norrie, two wonderful souls who have thrived not only in their own lives and relationship, but in bringing happiness, success, and freedom to others. Listen to them telling David their stories, what this wonderful business has done for them and how Network Marketing helped them see who they were meant to be.\r\nDavid started as a journalist, working in a radio station and writing for the sport section of a Newspaper. He loved being with people, and telling their stories; he identified with the human spirit. He was also a personal trainer on the side. He was unhappy and did not see a future in that business that would make him truly happy until he was introduced to the world of Network Marketing by his wife Angelike Norrie. They met when David had to reluctantly interview Angelike after having won some Fitness Competition! \r\nAngelike, a college drop-out, started in Martial Arts, winning championships, then gone to Corporate America and was very successful  in medical device sales after some bad knee injuries. After escaping 60-hour work weeks with extensive travel, she switched to Network Marketing and discovered the freedom to enjoy life, and the people in hers. Angelike is the author of “Life Lines”, a 4-part journal series for women. Using the power of technology, Angelike developed Lady Boss Training, an online monthly membership club for women who want to be mentored and coached with cutting edge health information, fun recipes, laughter and goofiness, and strategies for building happy, balanced lives and financial stability. Angelike’s philosophy and the Lady Boss program have been featured on NBC, ABC, CNN, FOX, and CBS.\r\nBooks:\r\nUnlimited Power by Anthony Robbins\r\n21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership by John C.

Today David talks about \"Trust\" and it's value, \"Truth\" and it's liberating powers.  He talks about the Power of trust to make us feel safe! On that topic, David plays us bits of Simon Sinek's speeches where he talks about trust and leadership. Simon talks about the military and companies, and explains how \"Leadership is a Choice not a Rank!\" And what makes people want to follow one person vs. another regardless of their rank and/or authority, only because those are the ones that have \"Chosen\" to look after the people around them.  \r\nA trained ethnographer and author of Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action, Simon Sinek has held a life-long curiosity for why people and organizations do the things they do. Sinek is an optimist. He believes in a bright future and our ability to build it together.\r\nDescribed as “a visionary thinker with a rare intellect,” Sinek teaches leaders and organizations how to inspire people. With a bold goal to help build a world in which the vast majority of people go home everyday feeling fulfilled by their work, Sinek is leading a movement to inspire people to do the things that inspire them.\r\nHe is best known for discovering the Golden Circle and popularizing the concept of Why, the purpose, cause or belief that drives every one of us. The Golden Circle is a naturally occurring pattern, grounded in the biology of human decision making, that explains why we are inspired by some people, leaders, messages and organizations over others.\r\nSinek shares his optimism with all who will listen. He speaks around the globe and has commented for local and national press, including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Houston Chronicle, FastCompany, CMO Magazine, NPR and BusinessWeek. Sinek is a regular contributor to The Huffington Post, writes his own blog, simonsinek.com and makes regular guest appearances on MSNBC’s Your Business, among others.\r\nSongs:\r\nSomeone Like You by Adele\r\nSaving Private Ryan - The Hymn to the Fallen by John Williams\r\nPeople by Barbara Streisand\r\nIn The Navy by Village People\r\nQuotes\r\n\"If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.\" John Quincy Adams",

David's guest today is Ben Kelly telling us about the effort it took to go from being depressed enough to contemplate suicide to a life of Freedom, happiness, and self-worth, surrounded by loving, caring, and interesting people.\r\n\r\nBen Kelly is relatively new to Network Marketing. He has been working the business for only 16 months, and is already enjoying the fruit of his work. He started as a professional brick layer, hating and dreading his job, an uncertain and inconsistent income, dealing with the idea that this was going to be his life until he got old and died, basically being in a hopeless, and depressive situation. After discovering Network Marketing, he not only grew his income from \"at best\" $1,200 a week, to \"at least\" $10,000 a week, in only 16 months, but also found hope, happiness and true Freedom. Ben and his sister, have both already achieved the most noble of goals which was to free their mother from the financial burdens she faced: They have already paid off her mortgage, and going steadily on.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what his take on Network Marketing is, he says: \" The abundance of choice it provides!\"\r\n\r\nDavid leaves us to contemplate on this true message of hope.\r\n\r\nHere's how to get in touch with Ben: https://www.facebook.com/ben.kelly.391082\r\n\r\nBooks:\r\nThe Power of NOW by Eckhart Tolle (Hardcover Edition)(Kindle Edition)\r\nAsk and It Is Given by Esther Hicks (Hardcover Edition)(Kindle Edition)\r\nThe Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham by Esther Hicks (Hardcover Edition)(Kindle Edition)\r\nThe Go Giver by Bob Burg and John David Mann (Kindle Edition) (Audio CD)",

In today’s show David names “unrealistic expectations” as the main reason why people quit, so he urges everyone to have realistic expectations, put in the work, go through the learning curve, and most importantly: give yourself time to get there.

David reminds us that: You can be part-time, you can be full-time, but you can’t be sometime!\r\n\r\nAs a special treat, David gives us some hints, dates, and insight into what he calls: The Countdown to The Woodstock of Personal Development!\r\n\r\nHe closes the show with some extremely valuable advice: Stop listening to broke unhappy people! And Crank up the Dial on your life!\r\n\r\nToday's Songs:\r\n“No Expectations” Rolling Stones",

A man who wants for nothing, and can chose anywhere in the whole world to live, but has chosen a remote island that can house only 40 people, to call home. A man who brings out a sense of honor and beauty in everything he touches. The man is Sir Richard Branson and the story is about his home, his private island, Necker.\r\nSir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950) is an English business magnate and investor. He is best known as the founder of Virgin Group, which comprises more than 400 companies. At the age of sixteen his first business venture was a magazine called Student. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business.
