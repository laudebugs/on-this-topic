            "description": "Hey, what’s that sound? The answer here is a little-known fact that needs to be spread more: you can customize the collision sound an object makes. That’s right, you can make a falling anvil sound like its cartoon counterpart, a glass can emit a startling \"crash!\", or you can do something completely different to confound and astound bystanders. You can even silence an object (like thunky stairs).\r\n\r\nNOTE: This feed is being \"frozen\" for an indefinite amount of time because of low usage. I apologize for the inconvenience. If you want to be notified of new video tutorials, please see http://secondlife.com/video or subscribe directly at http://lindenlab.blip.tv/ or http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Torley\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, feel free to contact Torley through his profile's Web tab :)",

Robbie Dingo was commissioned by Boliver Oddfellow (CEO, Infinite Visions) to make the Guitar and animation for the Vega avatar (created by Munchflower Zaius).
