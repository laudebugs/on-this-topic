            "description": "<p>Matt Cain’s gorgeous novel The Madonna of Bolton was turned down more than 30 times by publishers for being “too gay”. A coming of age story loosely based on Matt’s own experiences of being a gay Madonna fan growing up in northern England in the Eighties, it broke records at the crowdfunding publishing house Unbound. The book is now being turned into a film; there’s the option for a stage musical, and, to top it all off, Madonna has given it her blessing. BLIMEY!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matt joins Jo and James to talk about his determination and the extraordinary path his book has taken; the snobbery of the “guilty pleasure” concept; and why Madonna is such an inspiring icon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And of course, there are some vital topics to discuss: so is it James who’s not a superfan? Is it just Matt who loathes the sound of flip flops? And is it just Jo who’s a fairweather sports follower?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This week's episode was recorded on July 16.

She talks about how she's doing now, what she's up to with Disney, secret plans for later in the year, and tackles three completely life-altering topics with the gang: James confesses to loathing holidays, Jo's still obsessed with horoscopes, and what's the deal with selfies these days? Plus, listener Rebecca Langton says, \"Is it just me who doesn't have a side hustle?\" If you'd like Jo, James and their guest to discuss your IIJM, please do email the show at isitjustmepodcast@gmail.com.</p><p><br></p><p>This week's episode was recorded on February 6 at Acast Studios.

Kevin's currently appearing in Lady Windemere's Fan, and his impressions of his director, Kathy Burke, and co-star, Jennifer Saunders, fill the episode alongside his memories of a very long career. He even gives a shout out to his French art house films (modern languages students, represent. Or maybe that's just Kat...).
