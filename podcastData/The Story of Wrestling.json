    "description": "The Story Of Wrestling is a podcast that examines the world of pro wrasslin through the lens of storytelling. The A.V. Club's crack team of wrestling writers (plus hanger-on Alasdair Wilkins) break down the week in wrestling by focusing on the stories WWE is trying to tell, why those stories work, and why they sometimes don't. Plus, we do our level best to keep it positive (in as non-obnoxious a way as possible), just to mix things up.",

            "description": "Alasdair takes another sidestep out of the usual discussion to explore how wrestling compares with other kinds of collaborative performance like improv and Dungeons and Dragons. And who better to do that with his own Dungeon Master? Gideon Bautista is a writer, actor, wrestling fan, and longtime D&#38;D player, and he joins Alasdair to discuss how putting together a campaign is like booking a wrestling show. Is playing Dungeons and Dragons like being a wrestler, or is it like being an audience member, liable to take over the show at any point? All that plus plenty of love for WWE's newest Hall of Fame inductee, Dave \"The Animal\" Batista, or Hollywood star Dave Bautista, if you prefer. Is he the most talented actor to ever come out of a wrestling ring? Gideon explains how his fellow Bautista made use of classic Meisner technique in his famous promo on the road to this year's WrestleMania, which Shakespeare character the Animal most reminds him of, and how his 2009 heel turn on Rey Mysterio is absolutely chilling. It's a fun, free-ranging conversation about the mechanics of acting and storytelling in wrestling, so come listen!",

            "description": "Alasdair is back in the podcast studio this week joined by Rob Blatt, the \"management representative\" for the Queens-based promotion House of Glory Wrestling and senior referee for Dropkick Depression in New Jersey. That's right, we got a worker on the podcast! Rob details how he got into both wrestling and wrassling as a kid, including his dad's Valentine's Day present (!?) of tickets for the whole family to go see Flair vs. Piper in Nassau Coliseum. We discuss what led him to make the leap that probably more than a few wrestling fans have contemplated by actually going to wrestling school, albeit to become a despicable heel manager... and how he ended up having his first ever match with Homicide. Then we interrupt all that pleasantness to discuss Rob's hot take about All Elite Wrestling, which is that it's one big problem is, well, Kenny Omega. As hot takes go, it's calm, well-considered, and lets us dig into something AEW, which we're both basically in love with, could stand to improve on. Be sure to learn more about both upcoming shows Rob is taking part in by checking out @HOGwrestling for House of Glory and @OperationDD for Dropkick Depression!",

Also, AEW head Tony Khan may not be stepping into the ring anytime soon, but he's proved himself quite happy to hit some serious moves on Twitter, and this simply must be addressed.

After more than a year's hiatus, Alasdair has dusted off the podcast, with plans to start talking wrestling again now that there's so much (mostly outside WWE, we'll get into that) to talk about. As is typically customary for podcasts, there are plans to, uh, have *other* people on as well, but some last-minute scheduling snafus means Alasdair is by himself for this one, channeling his best heel-era Seth Rollins in the first segment of Raw to cut a 40-minute promo about why the podcast went away, why it's back, and what's next. Consider this a little reintroduction before the fun really starts back up again.",

We're here for the wrestling goodness of the Intercontinental Championship match, the great storytelling and even greater followup for the SmackDown Women's Championship match, and the shocking brilliance of the mixed tag.

We wonder what Braun Strowman could do at WrestleMania if he's not involved with the Universal Championship. And we look at the women of NXT and who has us most excited about their potential.",

Recording the night after New Japan's Wrestle Kingdom, we look at the most Canadian match ever (give or take the Harts, Edge and Christian, and Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn), as the twin toasts of Winnipeg Chris Jericho and Kenny Omega went at it for 36 glorious minutes. Check out this match if you haven't, or give us a chance to explain why this is worth watching, as it fuses the best of WWE and New Japan, with a bit of old-school Ric Flair-style psychology thrown in. Then we look at the bizarrely muddled main event scene on SmackDown and try to figure out who to root for other than Alasdair's beloved adult son A.J. Styles. We also are all-in on Jason Jordan, proto-heel.",

In happier news, we take a look at this weekend's activities, with a particular focus on the truly excellent NXT Takeover card. Plus we consider when Carmella should cash in and what a return to the Attitude Era would mean for modern-day WWE!",

Alasdair is looking to enlist some of you lovely wrestling fans to help predict the event of SummerSlam for Inverse, while Kyle is getting back in the WWE reviewing game at Real Sport 101! We've got all the details on both of those at the top of the episode. Next up, Kyle was in the building for SmackDown Live, and we discuss the rare thrill of being live in the building for Mahal-Orton IV. We also discuss some Wyatt Family members and what kinds of stories would best bring out their characters. Finally we run down the card for Progress Wrestling's New York show this Saturday night (which, incidentally, we recorded before the late-breaking news that Pete Dunne is out of action for the show).",

Alasdair and Jim analyze why WWE loves this kind of story so much and why some wrestlers are able to be interesting despite it (Kevin Owens!) while others aren't (sigh... Jinder).

We connect the matches on Saturday and Sunday to the shifting storylines on Monday and Tuesday. We start with Roman Reigns discussion, because there's really no way around it, but we segue into Alasdair unapologetically marking out over Tye Dillinger and Emma, as is only proper. Plus we discuss the return of Matt and Jeff Hardy, the cruiserweights, and the Raw women's championship match. Stay tuned for the second half of our massive, three-hour WrestleMania fallout discussion, coming very soon.",

Chris Jericho vs. Kevin Owens! John Cena and Nikki Bella vs. the Miz and Maryse!), the not so good (Dean Ambrose vs. Baron Corbin! A fairly lifeless tag team ladder match! Intriguing but unfocused women's matches!), and the just kind of confusing (Roman Reigns vs. the Undertaker! Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg! A.J. Styles vs. Shane McMahon in a traditional wrestling match!). All in all, it's actually a pretty exciting card, especially when you keep in mind neither Samoa Joe nor Luke Harper is anywhere on the card, and they figure to get involved somehow. All that and some Mania-level fantasy-booking, with Alasdair suggesting Styles vs. Nakamura for the Intercontinental title (have they ever done something like that?), Braun vs. Big Show for the U.S. title while Jericho and Owens go for the big belt, and an absurdly detailed pitch for a women's Money in the Bank match to open Mania.",

We also consider what's going on in SmackDown, and whether the Orton-Wyatt story is worthy of one of the three or four Mania main event spots. And we take some questions as we wonder how to salvage the tag division (either of them, doesn't matter) and rebook from the Royal Rumble to get the kind of main event worthy of Mania.

            "description": "Just in time for Monday Night Raw comes our story-focused recap of the past week in wrestling. While week one cohost Kyle Fowle completed his Roman Reigns cosplay by getting popped for a wellness violation, fellow A.V. Club wrestling writer LaToya Ferguson ably steps in. We look at the fallout of Kevin Owens's big Universal Championship win, why 2016 really is the year of Heath Slater (baybay!), and Alasdair possibly breaks LaToya's brain forever when suggesting one of last week's intergender tag teams should just straight-up rename themselves the Dana Club. The Dana Club! Plus our hosts accidentally get into a game of indie wrestling can-you-top-this, which Alasdair should have known going in that he damn well can't.",

            "description": "The Story Of Wrestling is a podcast that examines the world of pro wrasslin through the lens of storytelling. In the debut episode, A.V. Club writers Alasdair Wilkins and Kyle Fowle discuss five ridiculously packed days of wrestling, including NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn II and the beauty of tag team wrestling, where AJ Styles goes after his big SummerSlam win over John Cena, and how Smackdown! Live is crafting a story where every character matters. All that plus some in-ring thoughts on the future of Brock Lesnar, a weird bit of trivia about all the NXT champions, Alasdair's ridiculously implausible dream opponent for prospective WWE champion AJ Styles, the Miz's promo of the year, and an amazing bit of inter-brand continuity between the Cruiserweight Classic and NXT. We're just scratching the surface here, honestly. Come join us!",
