He's also a 3x Pro-Bowler.</p><p>While Michael’s craft is football, there is so much more to Michael the human being.</p><p>He’s an advocate for social justice and after the events of the last week and the ongoing protests, I wanted to have him on the podcast to more than anything else just … listen.</p><p>Michael’s words are significant. He has much to share. But what I found even more powerful than his words was his tone.</p><p>He doesn’t once raise his voice, he doesn’t blame others, yet you can hear the pain in his voice. You can hear the yearning for change; for a different America.</p><p>We discuss the systemic issues that make everyday life difficult for African-Americans and what each of us can do to make a positive impact going forward.</p><p>This is an incredibly difficult, yet important time for our country.</p><p>I recognize that change requires action and solely talking about it will not suffice.</p><p>At the same time, I hope that we can use this platform to continue to learn, to better understand, and to empathize with those who have felt silenced for so long.</p><p>------</p><p>Please support our partners!</p><p>We're able to keep growing and creating content for&nbsp;<strong>YOU</strong>&nbsp;because of their support.

And I think that's the perfect analogy for how I feel every day of life. It’s not that I'm afraid to make a mistake or a paralyzing feeling, but it actually gives me clarity. I can hear the clock ticking, I know that I have this awful disease, but it helps me to focus on what's important and what's not important.</em></p><p>And that really sets the tone for this conversation.</p><p>We discuss the preciousness of life and why it really comes down to having clarity of purpose and making sure you take the proper actions to back it up.</p><p>David also shares how his lab is approaching finding a cure for COVID-19.</p><p><br></p><p>------</p><p>Please support our partners!</p><p>We're able to keep growing and creating content for&nbsp;<strong>YOU</strong>&nbsp;because of their support.

Now imagine this at a microscopic level and you have an idea of what the microbiome looks like inside our bodies, consisting of trillions of microorganisms (also called microbiota or microbes) of thousands of different species.</p><p>These include not only bacteria but fungi, parasites, and viruses. In a healthy person, these “bugs” coexist peacefully, with the largest numbers found in the small and large intestines but also throughout the body.</p><p>The microbiome is even labeled a supporting organ because it plays so many key roles in promoting the smooth daily operations of the human body.</p><p>Each person has an entirely unique network of microbiota that is originally determined by one’s DNA.</p><p>A person is first exposed to microorganisms as an infant, during delivery in the birth canal and through the mother’s breast milk.</p><p>Exactly which microorganisms the infant is exposed to depends solely on the species found in the mother. Later on, environmental exposures and diet can change one’s microbiome to be either beneficial to health or place one at greater risk for disease.</p><p>The microbiome consists of microbes that are both helpful and potentially harmful. Most are symbiotic (where both the human body and microbiota benefit) and some, in smaller numbers, are pathogenic (promoting disease). In a healthy body, pathogenic and symbiotic microbiota coexist without problems.</p><p>But if there is a disturbance in that balance—brought on by infectious illnesses, certain diets, or the prolonged use of antibiotics or other bacteria-destroying medications—dysbiosis occurs, stopping these normal interactions.</p><p>As a result, the body may become more susceptible to disease.</p><p>And so this is where Raja’s company, Seed comes into play.</p><p>Seed partners with leading scientists to translate breakthrough science into live biotherapeutics and innovations for consumer health with a portfolio targeting conditions where bacteria can become or replace the primary standard of care.</p><p>Seed, develops scientifically-validated, next-generation probiotics with a mission to bring much-needed precision, efficacy, and education to the global probiotics market.</p><p>Raja believes the magic happens at the intersection of technology, systems biology, and translational science.</p><p>He’s got a unique way of thinking and follows those thoughts with action.</p><p>And that’s what this conversation is really about— how to take an idea powerful enough to change the world for the better and make it a reality?</p><p>------</p><p>Please support our partners!</p><p>We're able to keep growing and creating content for&nbsp;<strong>YOU</strong>&nbsp;because of their support.

He was a unanimous All-American and team captain in 1980 and graduated in 1981 with a degree in public administration.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, he became the first-round draft pick of the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>His legendary football career included four Super Bowl titles and 10 Pro-Bowl appearances.</p><p>He is one of only five 49ers to play on all of the team’s 1980s Super Bowl wins.

            "description": "\n        <p>This week’s conversation is with Mick Fanning, a professional surfer from Australia, regarded as one of the best&nbsp;surfers ever.</p><p>Mick won the ASP World Tour in 2007, 2009 and 2013 and is the living embodiment of professional surfing.</p><p>He’s spent the better part of two decades as one of the biggest gravitational forces on the Tour, racking up 22 Tour wins, 11 Top 5 finishes in addition to those three World Titles.</p><p>For over 20 years Mick’s schedule has been dictated by event dates and locations — and in the past few years, his gut told him it was time to step away, officially retiring in 2018.</p><p>This conversation isn’t so much about surfing as it is about Mick’s will to be great, his unflappable resiliency, and the cost of this pursuit.</p><p>Mick has been through it all — the highs and the lows.</p><p>Catastrophic injuries have sidelined him multiple times during his career and he’s also had to deal with the passing of not just one, but two his brothers, and other close friends.</p><p>Some of you may be familiar with Mick from an incident in July of 2015 when he was attacked by a Great White shark during the finals of the J-Bay Open in South Africa.</p><p>It was broadcasted on a live webcast, where you can actually see Mick punch the shark and survive unscathed.</p><p>For some people that type of trauma could keep them out of the water for a lifetime, but not Mick.</p><p>He made three finals in 2015 and went into a historic world title race to finish the year in the No. 2 slot.</p><p>And trauma is something we definitely touch on in this conversation.</p><p>As a refresher, Big “T” traumas are the events most commonly&nbsp;associated with post-traumatic stress disorder&nbsp;(PTSD) including serious injury, sexual violence, or life-threatening experiences.</p><p>Little “t” traumas are highly distressing events that affect individuals on a personal level but don’t fall into the big “T” category.</p><p>What is highly distressing to one person may not cause the same emotional response in someone else, so the key to understanding little “t” trauma is to examine how it affects the individual rather than focusing on the event itself.</p><p>You may not even realize how a Little “t” in your life is impacting your thoughts and actions.</p><p>&nbsp;------</p><p>Please support our partners!</p><p>We're able to keep growing and creating content for&nbsp;<strong>YOU</strong>&nbsp;because of their support.

A full ironman triathlon is 140+ miles (consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a 26.22-mile&nbsp;marathon run, raced in that order).</p><p>In 2018, Angela, while battling Lyme disease, placed 8th at the Ironman World Championships with a time of 8:57, which is just remarkable.</p><p>So why compete with Lyme disease – why put her body through something that intense?</p><p>For&nbsp;Angela, it’s about using sport as a means to help her better understand herself and discover what she’s capable of, what she’s made of.</p><p>It’s about doing it for her own satisfaction rather than trying to appease others, which is something she’s had to work on.</p><p>And that’s really what this conversation is all about: discovery and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>Self-discovery&nbsp;involves testing yourself; that feedback, that information, is part of the process for figuring out who you are.</p><p>Self-acceptance involves taking that information and embracing the true nature of it; it’s about getting comfortable in your own skin.</p><p>They go hand in hand and Angela has a very eloquent way of describing her process for it— I hope you find ways to apply those lessons.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;------</p><p>Please support our partners!</p><p>We're able to keep growing and creating content for&nbsp;<strong>YOU</strong>&nbsp;because of their support.

You can’t be balanced.”</p><p>So if you knew that ahead of time, would you still pursue it? It’s a great question and why I love these conversations so much.</p><p>They really make you think about who you are and what you value most – at least they do for me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This episode is brought to you by WHOOP and Athletic Greens.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHOOP</strong>: Starting today you can join WHOOP for $30 a month, six month minimum to begin.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The WHOOP membership service includes the WHOOP Strap 2.0, professional analytics via its mobile and web apps, and a powerful community of performance-minded individuals.

She first began teaching mindfulness in 1974.</p><p>(Note: be careful who teaches you about mindfulness — it’s a very, very “in” thing to talk about, and just like most skills in any field, the nuances that come with a deep commitment to understanding and living in alignment are imperative for anyone you’re going to trust in the process of progression.)</p><p>In 1971, in Bodh Gaya, India, Sharon attended her first meditation course. She spent the next three-and-a-half years engaged in intensive practice and study with highly respected teachers from India, Burma and Tibet.</p><p>In 1976, she established, together with Joseph Goldstein and Jack Kornfield, the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Massachusetts.</p><p>In this conversation you’ll hear depth. You’ll hear the sensitivities that come with a life commitment to the nuances.</p><p>We explore how Sharon discovered mindfulness and how it can serve as a toolbox for managing suffering.</p><p>When Sharon first encountered mindfulness, she was fascinated that there were actual mental tools available to anyone who wants to practice them.</p><p>Sharon’s definition of faith is not about dogma or adherence to dogma, but getting off the sidelines and moving right to the center of possibility, offering your heart to something even though you don’t know how it’s going to work out.</p><p>And that’s precisely what she did once she had her first taste of meditation.</p><p>For Sharon one of the most important things she learned is the ability to “let go.”</p><p>To come back to your intention, to come back to the now, without being disheartened, without blaming or hating yourself, for what occurred in the past.</p><p>It’s the eloquent returning to now that is the hallmark of world-class doers and thinkers. This is a skill. And mindfulness is one of the many skills that can accelerate the ability to stitch together moments of full engagement.</p><p>We also explore how practicing compassion doesn’t mean you can’t still compete and can still have a mindset that allows you to progress and achieve.</p><p>Sharon has great insight – for both the seasoned and those just getting into mindfulness/meditation world.</p><p>We are living in a highly digital world that is challenging our ancient brain in ways that we are not fully prepared. I hope this conversation stimulates you to step back and remember what matters most: time — and how we live “on-time” with our self, with others, with nature.</p><p>It’s through relationships that we become — and that depth only happens in the present moment.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens!</p><p>Receive a free 20-count travel pack of Athletic Greens (valued at $99) with any purchase!</p><p>Claim here: athleticgreens.com/findingmastery</p>\n      ",

            "description": "\n        <p>This week’s conversation is with Tom Carroll on being a maverick, honesty, and risk.</p><p>Tom is best known as one of Australia’s great surfers and sportsmen.&nbsp;</p><p>I have known of Tom since I was a grom (stoked little kid who flat out loved surfing).</p><p>With two world professional surfing championships and three wins at Pipeline (one of the heavier waves in the world) under his belt, you’d be forgiven for thinking he’s just a champion athlete.</p><p>Rather Tom is a maverick -- in many ways.</p><p>Reaching the professional level of any sport has its fair share of challenges, but in the modern era, there is generally some sort of path or map to follow -- like in baseball, gymnastics, or soccer -- there's a variety of developmental clubs / teams / or university systems that help cultivate and weed out those that have \"it\" and those that don't.</p><p>Coaching and feedback along the way and physical training would be assumed,</p><p>Tom emerged in an era where none of this existed and essentially had to figure it out as he went. He was part of the beginnings of the action sport and surf industry, before it was an industry. He was making the map, or at least looking for the bread crumbs that other legends before him left behind.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom won 2 titles before he ever saw footage of himself surfing.</p><p>That is just hard to conceive in the world we live in today.</p><p>This conversation is with a man who fell in love with the water at age 7 and has lived it ever since.</p><p>Tom has a relaxed and engaging way of sharing his experiences: as a kid falling for the wild elegance of the waves, as a pro surfer ripping and partying his way around the globe with a bunch of like minded maniacs in the days before social media, as a big wave charger hunting down unridden mountains of water, and as a man who fell into heavy drug use and almost tore it all to bits, before embracing sobriety and re-discovering his better self in the process.</p><p>For Tom, rediscovering his better self, came down to honesty. Once he was able to be honest with himself, he could start working on being a better man.</p><p>When we think about mastery, I think we are learning there are many paths, many triggers for what drives each of these unique people to go the distance for what they want most.&nbsp;</p><p>What I love so much about Tom and this conversation is it’s raw authenticity -- his humility -- his vulnerability -- his ability to take risks (some to progress his skill, others on the darker side of humanness) -- and his track record of going big on the world-stage. He's earned and is still earning his insights.</p><p>It’s easy to get caught up in what you should or shouldn’t be doing. The norms of society: how much money you should make, when you should get married, whether you should do this or that.</p><p>Tom has carved his own path.</p><p>In this conversation it feels like we get to go back to a simpler time where we get to learn about a journey of a man engaging in the purest forms of life.</p><p>Tom is authentic, he’s genuine, and he has an incredible story to share.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.</p><p>Receive a free 20-count travel pack of Athletic Greens (valued at $99) with any purchase!</p><p>Claim here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fathleticgreens.com%2Ffindingmastery\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/findingmastery</a></p><p><br></p>\n      ",

What is my purpose? What is real?</p><p>At 11 years of age Robert asked himself those 3 questions and has been on a relentless journey to answer them ever since.</p><p>The spirit of inquiry, wondering, and curiosity has allowed him to go deeper and further than most people – deeper than those that accept a preexisting condition of knowledge.</p><p>In this conversation we take a deep dive into mindfulness and the meaning of a “thought stream.”</p><p>We discuss why words and language can be insufficient when it comes to truly understanding what is transpiring as an experience of being \"here now.\"</p><p>Robert shares how listening deeply without projection, allowing space to be playful, and removing ego are all at the center of what has made him successful.</p><p>Robert has developed an international reputation as a brilliant speaker and&nbsp;public speaking guru, as well as a distinguished self-awareness facilitator and leadership advisor.</p><p>He's an author: Two of his books that I've appreciated are: The 5 Principles of Authentic Living, and Speak Truthfully.</p><p>I hope this conversation drives you to think just a bit deeper and get curious about who you really are.&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

He's literally a living legend in the field of Psychology -- He's an extraordinarily innovative scholar whose work in social cognitive theory has become an incredible resource in academics and for practitioners dedicated to human excellence </p><p>His theories are part the core pillars with my work with elite teams, athletes, and performers. It was a complete joy to learn from him in this conversation, after I've spent so many years from him via research articles. </p><p>His research changed our understanding of human learning -- how modeling and interactions impact learning - and how we can become more powerful as humans, in a variety of circumstances. He laid the theoretical foundation for understanding the self-regulatory mechanism for his theory on human agency. </p><p>Human Agency is defined as the human capability to exert influence over one’s functioning and the course of events by one’s actions. &nbsp;</p><p>Albert’s “Theory of Agency” has 3 elements.&nbsp;1st, you have to project yourself into the future to have something to work toward. 2nd, is self-regulation, the extent that you can regulate your thoughts, emotions and behavior. The 3rd is self-reflection, to what extent you can judge your capabilities (also known as self efficacy). Self-Efficacy theory is at the center of much of my work with professional athletes and performers. </p><p>While this might not sound novel now, this was a radical idea when he first introduced the concept that: Human beings are not just reacting to influences, they have a capacity to shape the course of their lives.</p><p>Dr. Bandura pushed against conventional wisdom by introducing the notion that our thinking influences our behavior, our behavior influences our environment and our environment can influences how we view the world and ourselves. &nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Bandura is game-changer -- a significant contributor to the betterment of human life</p>\n      ",

Wendy has a specialty in treating narcissists and the people who live with and deal with them.\n \nShe is the author of \"Disarming the Narcissist -- surviving and thriving with the self-absorbed” translated in 10 languages. \n \nNarcissism and world-class achievement have an interesting relationship. When we think of those who excel on the world stage, it'd be easy to conjure up a story that they have a deep inner belief that they can be the absolute best in the world (that's actually not the case, as we've come to learn from many of the folks on the Finding Mastery Podcast. \n \nBut for those who do hold that belief -- THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND ME BECAUSE I’M THAT IMPORTANT AND SPECIAL --is when my antenna tends to attune to the concept of narcissism. \n \nIt's the excessive self-centered vanity and lack of regard for others that is one of the hallmarks of narcissism. We can all be self-absorbed, needy….. display narcissistic behavior from time to time…that's not what this is about….it's when the sense of grandiosity is so pervasive that it impairs daily functioning with others, and in essence, within themselves. \n \nNarcissism is named for the Greek myth of Narcissus—who was a hunter and when he saw his own reflection in the water, he fell in love with it, not realizing it was merely an image. He stared at his reflection until he died. \n \nThe way I like to simplify narcissism, is that the person can't tell the difference between himself and everyone around him -- everyone then becomes a reflection of his him -- in which gives him the right to use them as extensions of his own self-worth (even if that means public embarrassment). \n \nThere was an interesting piece of research in the Journal of applied sport psychology, 2013, by Ross Roberts and team -- where they found that the more narcissistic a person was, the less they benefited from psychological skills training - in other words, all you had to do for them, is turn on the lights, and they came alive. \n \nIf you have ever thought, am I'm living with or working with a narcissist, or am I a narcissist? Wendy provides ways to tease that out.  She dives into why so many elite performs are narcissists, and how we can be more effective with living and working with them. \n\n      ",

If you're in the states you would call him a soccer player.\n\nHe had a long career- from 1989 to 2009 and at the time I met him he was the coach of the Tottenham Hotspur under-23 team. \n\nUgo had this inner brilliance, this humility and thoughtfulness that was apparent right from the first interaction. \n\nIt was the handshake and the eye contact that gave it away. \n\nIt was the combination of the way that he carried himself with the words that he chose and maybe even more striking was the care that he took to choose the words to find the most authentic way to express what he's come to understand. \n\nUgo and I were not able to finish this conversation and it's heartbreaking. It's for two reasons.\n\nThe first made sense. He needed to run out onto the field and begin his coaching for his under-23 team. \n\nThe second reason is harder to process. \n\nUgo passed away at the age of 44 before we were able to reconnect. And I think probably a lot of people would say before they were able to reconnect with him, which is the tragic part of it. \n\nI can only imagine what it's like for his wife, his family, and his children.\n\nAnd so with the highest regard for the man that I briefly met and condolences to his family, I did as much reading as I possibly could to understand his life and his death.\n\nSo many of the people that commented on who he is -- players and coaches and friends -- described him as a great player and a wonderful human. \n\nI feel fortunate to have had this conversation and to have had a brief interaction with him and I'm honored to be able to celebrate his genius. It did come through in the short time that we spent together. \n\nThank you Ugo for the time that we spent sharing your insights and reminding us all of how important it is to love.\n\n      ",

I really enjoy the conversations, that at the end, I walk away saying, man I'd love to spend more time him/her….This was one of those conversations. \n\nHe's known for his skill of asking great questions -- yet his talent of storytelling is world class. \n\nQuestions are to illicit responses and engagement -- and -- there is so much more beneath the surface of an answer -- body gestures, emotions, hints of motivation, and ultimately, snips of the framework that the person is working to share how they understand the world (and people). It's all in there -- does the responder orientate to protect, to embrace…..to explore, to have fun? And -- Cal takes that understanding to the next level by doing it artistically through storytelling. \n\nWe all have a story -- thousands of stories. Cal pulls back the curtain to share his -- and the challenge is set for us all to become better at asking questions to learn other's stories -- and -- to become thoughtful on how we share our own stories with people who are thoughtful -- caring -- interested -- enough to offer their time and attention. \n\nThis is a two part episode -- it's too good, way to good to cram. When you listen to Cal's stories, listen for the framework, for the stuff underneath the surface -- and -- also see if you can listen to how he constructs his stories. \n\nWe also talk about the art of interrupting others -- during storytelling -- He doesn't -- I do, and we have fun with it (and if you've ever wondered why I purposefully  interrupt folks -- it's all by design, and we talk about it just a bit in this conversation). \n      ",

In spite of all of these obstacles, David never had a “woe is me” mentality.\n\nDavid is the only member of the U.S. Armed Forces to complete SEAL training (including two Hell Weeks), the U.S. Army Ranger School (where he graduated as Enlisted Honor Man) and Air Force tactical air controller training.\n\nDavid has completed multiple ultra-marathons, triathlons, ultra-triathlons, bike races and arduous mountain ascents, setting new course records and regularly placing in the top five. His achievements made him the subject of a lead feature in Runner’s World, where he was named “Running Hero”, and Outside Magazine named him “The Fittest (Real) Man in America.” The Navy SEALs even asked him to be their poster-boy and appear in a recruiting commercial.\n      ",

It’s with singer-songwriter Jewel and also features a guest appearance from Wisdom 2.0 founder Soren Gordhamer.\n\nSoren’s brought tech leaders and wisdom leaders together to have a deep exchange of ideas and practices with one purpose: how to better impact the living and working environments for us and maybe the next generation.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Wisdom 2.0, I encourage you to go check it out.  Their next conference is in San Francisco from February 17-19.\n\nThis conversation is primarily about Jewel - her path, her insights and where her music comes from. \n\nJewel’s path is completely her own, yet at the same time, just like yours, just like mine, just like so many of us. \n\nShe touches on universal concepts and principles that cut across humanity, that cut across all people. \n\nIt's the deeper calling to belong to love, to touch our own potential and humanity, to adjust to the difficult and stay true to what authenticity means.\n\nTo me that is a fundamental skill and approach to life, that is right at the center of what she's about. \n\nHer courage is demonstrated by her willingness to look within and not turn away from what is painful and dark --and there lies the spring from where her truth is expressed -- and -- in return the music, the movements, the words, and thoughts that come together to form beauty. \n\nI hope that comes across in this conversation.\n\nAs a reminder these conversations are long form. There's no way to hack or shortcut the insights that people have worked their entire life to try to understand. There are no shortcuts for this and so the there should be no short cuts for the learning either. \n\nWe want to be proficient, we want to be as expedient as we can possibly be in learning, but at the same time let’s embrace the long form and the watering of ideas, knowing that there's so much more to still unpack.\n\nIn this conversation, we jump into why fear is a “thief.” \n\nIsn't that a cool word for fear?\n\nWe also discuss doing the hard work to figure out who you truly are, what forgiveness means to Jewel, and why perfectionism has been an inhibitor to mastery or her.\n\nI want to share this idea one more time with you guys that: “every day is an opportunity to create a living masterpiece.”\n\nThis conversation pulls on that thread like you wouldn't believe. So together hopefully we can make this commitment to carve our unique paths with some fuel and some fire and just really get after it in life.\n\n      ",

We go pretty deep into a handful of mental skills, as well as, specific ways to begin a mindfulness training program.\n\nThere's no time like now to get started, or to re-start (over and over and over again) training your mind. It's not complicated, but it does take time. Know your ideal mindset (for the craft your invested in). Know the inner-dialog that supports and gets in your way. Invest in breathing, so that you can have a command of your activation levels when you need it.

The spoils of victory might just happen, but the orientation of the intent is paramount.\nToday we are becoming overwhelmed with the need for instant reward, immediate verification that we are significant -- as a misguided attempt to satiate our thirst for meaning and belonging --  rather, we are propelling ourselves toward an emptiness that can only be filled by temporary pleasures.\nOur need to belong, to understand, to explore, to connect to others and the world around us, to know safety and to know risk, to express and create are foundational to the human experience.\nMastery is a journey — It's a curious and wonderful trail -- that has few, if any, guides. It's much more than the pursuit of expert performance. It's far deeper than high performance and the achievement of success.\nIf Mastery is a path, let's learn from as many voices as we can.

He also asked to list three names below the line, that have negatively contributed to how we see ourselves.\nThe purpose of the exercise was to reflect on the way that people “coached” us from an “above the line” perspective.\nCoach Tom Osborne is an above the line coach — for tens-of-thousands of men and women. His deep care for others is apparent in the way he conducts his life — and his life efforts.\nThomas William “Tom” Osborne (born February 23, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, college athletics administrator, and politician from Nebraska. He served as the head football coach at the University of Nebraska football team for 25 years, from 1973 to 1997. Osborne was one of the most successful coaches in American college football history, with a career record of 255–49–3, 13 conference championships, and three national championships. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1999.\nOsborne was later elected U.S. Representative from Nebraska’s 3rd congressional district, as a Republican. He served three terms, from 2001 to 2007. In 2007, he returned to the University of Nebraska as athletic director (AD). He retired as AD in January 2013.\nHe lives a life of love and purpose — and is deeply devoted to his faith, his wife and children, and the service of mentoring others.

Sports, Design, Stanford, Violin, Composing.\nHe holds an engineering degree from Stanford University’s d. school where he was introduced to the innovative culture of Silicon Valley. As a Kleiner Perkins Design Fellow and Mayfield Fellow, Kai got an early start in entrepreneurship.\nKai began playing the violin when he was 3 years old, was classically trained, and studied under the concertmaster of Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra. His music has brought him to perform in venues such as the White House and the Great Wall of China.\nToday Kai composes his own music using an innovative style on the violin which blends classical technique with rhythms and textures from popular genres such as hip hop and jazz. His favorite composer is Bach, because of the soul riveting harmony and improvisational rhythms.\nHe is thoughtful, articulate, and working to let his heart be felt.\n      ",

Throughout the past 15 years, Michael has been in the trenches with some of the best performers in the world – some who shift how we conceive what’s possible — others who have pushed their own boundaries — ranging from hall of fame athletes to action sport game-changers,  entrepreneurs, Mixed Martial Artists, to musicians who influence the rhythm of the world. He’s excited to share the many paths toward mastery and provide very applied practices that we can all use to be and do more in our time together.\n      ",
