Having set the plot in motion, there are only a couple of ways that it can end. But kudos to Norman MacDonnell who produced and directed. Lawrence Dobkin played Edward and Paula Winslowe played Joan. Also appearing were Edgar Barrier, Joseph Kearns, and Richard Peel. James Helvick was a pseudonym for Francis Claud Cockburn (1904-1981), a British journalist and novelist who wrote an interesting book about the phenomenon of the best-selling novel.
