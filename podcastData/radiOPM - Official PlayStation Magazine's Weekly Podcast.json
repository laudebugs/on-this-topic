Tune in as a cast of special guests jump in to give radiOPM (and OPM) a hearty sendoff. Along the way we find out the identity of Mancrab, what goes on under Scooter's desk, and what happened on all those long, crazy deadline nights. If you listen to just one episode of radiOPM in your life...well, you probably don't want to listen to this one. But for those of you who stuck with us from the beginning, this is for you. Thanks for listening.

You'll thrill to the dulcimer sounds of Tom, Dana, Giancarlo, Scooter and DVD editor Logan Parr as they drone on about the July issue, Guitar Hero 2, chatty RPGs, the monthly disc, PR pet peeves and why you should teach your kids not to \"die dumb.\"<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/1up/OPM/Radiopm?a=UHcnQ1w9\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/1up/OPM/Radiopm?d=41\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/1up/OPM/Radiopm?a=g0i9diGD\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/1up/OPM/Radiopm?d=50\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div>",
