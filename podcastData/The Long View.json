            "description": "In this special episode of The Long View, I'm pleased to be joined by designers Phil Eklund and Philipp Klarmann as we discuss game design, and the upcoming game of Greenland. In the episode we discuss what makes Mr. Eklund's earlier designs and this new title so unique, the value of collaboration, the difference between a game and a simulation, and the role of education in game design. Along the way, \"the Phils\" tease us with some glimpses of even more new designs!\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, I also review two new titles. The first is an outrageously fun new game from Eagle Gryphon titled Lords and Ladies, and then I discuss the fascinating mash-up of Chess and Deckbuilding found in For the Crown (Second edition) from Victory Point Games. The Lords and Ladies review can be found at the 1:45:00 mark of the episode, and the For the Crown review can be found at the 2:01:06 mark of the episode.\r\n\r\nAs a note, we discuss the game of Greenland quite a bit, but never dive into the game itself in great detail, the focus is squarely on the design process and decisions made during the making of the game. If you would like a more complete picture of the game before or after you listen, please go the the Greenland game page and check out the video I made with W. Eric Martin at Gen Con, or listen to my review of the game in the Gen Con episode which you can find here in the BGG database, or at the podcast webpage of www.thelongviewpodcast.com\r\n\r\nThanks, as always, to my sponsor www.gamesurplus.com, The Dice Tower and, of course, thanks to YOU for listening!<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheLongViewPodcast/~4/-8WR7i4A8Jc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
