            "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><em>This episode of Flashback Friday was originally published on: May 1, 2012 </em></p> <p class=\"p2\">Jason Hartman is joined on this episode by Greg Farrell, author of Crash of the Titans: Greed, Hubris, The Fall of Merrill Lynch, and the Near Collapse of Bank of America, for a discussion of the economic crash and the resulting bailouts, as well as some of the inside dealings with some of the major banks, such as the buyouts by Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"p2\">Greg explains how these banks that participated in the buyouts grossly underestimated the depth of problems in their own banks and in those they acquired. Greg relates his research on Merrill Lynch’s attempt in the 1980s to become more like Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, which was to their detriment because they lacked the expertise for such business practices, and became involved in and in the middle of many of the scandals of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. Like CitiGroup, they were in over their head.</p> <p class=\"p2\">Jason and Greg discuss Wall Street in general and then specific financial groups regarding the recklessness and risky businesses, funds, etc, that they entertained to give the impression of higher rates of returns. As the plot unfolded, large bonuses to CEOs and high-producing brokers came into play, which encouraged an all or nothing attitude toward the company and fostered a “me” attitude versus long-term stability of the company. Greg also talks about what he calls the “Charlotte Mafia,” the clash of company cultures.</p> <p class=\"p2\">Greg Farrell is a correspondent for the Financial Times. In January 2009, he broke the news that Merrill Lynch had paid out its 2008 bonuses a month ahead of schedule, in December, even though Merrill was in the process of losing $28 billion for the year, and Bank of America needed an extra $20 billion in taxpayer funds to complete its acquisition of the firm. That story sparked an investigation by New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo.</p> <p class=\"p2\">Greg is a past winner of the American Business Press’s Jesse Neal Award for investigative reporting and a recipient of the Knight-Bagehot Fellowship for business journalism. He earned a BA from Harvard University and an MBA from the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University.</p>",

From the friendly environs of her newly completed McMansion in lower Alabama, the talk turns to fostering an ownership mentality with tenants.Whether you self-manage or go the property management route, this is a critical concept to understand. In short, the trick is to get your tenant thinking of the property as his/her house and to take pride in ownership. In nuts and bolts terms, it's the difference between getting a call at midnight asking to have a light bulb changed or having the tenant in the mindset to do it themselves.</p> <p class=\"p1\">When it comes to tenant self-sufficiency, you might find it difficult to beat one of Mom's tenants. This incredible guy has rented the same place for 25 years. Present and future landlords looking for income property investing success should take this case study to heart. He spent $1,400 to seed the lawn. $3,000 to build a brick wall on one side of the property. And when the hot water heater goes out, he's willing to install it himself. This tenant has the ownership mentality down to a science.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The second half of the show features guest Scott Shellady, Senior Vice-President of Derivatives of the Trean Group. Wait! Don't click away. Too many people think they can't understand derivatives, and we're here to prove you wrong. Listen to Scott break the idea down into layman's terms. You may not want to invest in them but you need to understand what they are and how they fit into the greater financial world scheme.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Mr. Shellady also devotes time talking about the reality of retirement for Generation X in today's goofy financial climate. It's too risky to divide your portfolio into an even 50% split into stocks and bonds, so what do you do?</p> <p class=\"p1\">In This Episode:</p> <p class=\"p1\">* Jason and Scott exchange dueling definitions of derivatives. Is it like trading insurance or \"the thing about the thing?\"<br /> * What are the one-percenters investing in right now?<br /> * What SWAGER means to your investment strategy<br /> * How to profit in the face of the manufactured stock rally<br /> * What's killing the financial future of the ninety-nine percenters<br /> * Why Gen Xers should figure on working longer before retirement<br /> * How to calculate a security deposit<br /> *Why being too friendly can cost you money<br /> *Even better than an extra deposit is to charge monthly pet rent<br /> *And much more…</p> <p class=\"p1\">Links:</p> <p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"http://www.treangroup.com/\">www.TreanGroup.com</a><br /> <a href= \"http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/2698724\">Check out this episode!</a></span></p>",

Normally Jason asks the questions, but today, host Kerry Lutz of the Financial Survival Network sets the agenda. What transpires is a nuts and bolts crash course in the exact reasons single family residential properties are Jason's preferred form of investing, bar none. Better than the stock market or gold by a long shot, and safer than apartment complexes or commercial properties. If you have an interest in a better understanding of the kind of investing that creates actual wealth for the long term, don't skip this show.</p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>About Kerry Lutz</strong></p> <p class=\"p3\">Kerry Lutz has been a student of Austrian Economics since 1977. While attending Pace University, he stumbled upon an extensive cache of Austrian Economic Literature in a dark, musty, abandoned section of the school's library. After graduating from The New York Law School, he became an attorney and life-long serial entrepreneur. His diverse career has included: running a legal printing company, practicing commercial law and litigation and founding a successful distressed asset investment company.<br /> In 2010, Kerry gave up most of his other interests to pursue his long held desire of becoming a radio show host. Thus the Financial Survival Network was born. Its mission, much like that of Jason Hartman's, is helping you to survive and thrive in the New Economy. He has done hundreds of interviews with such financial luminaries as Peter Schiff, Harry S. Dent, Martin Armstrong and Peter Grandich. Kerry now appears on 1230 WBZT, in West Palm Beach, FL, every Sunday from 9am-10pm EST.</p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>In This Episode, Jason Addresses:</strong></p> <ul class=\"ul1\"> <li class=\"li4\">Is the dollar collapse real or fiction and why it might not matter</li> <li class=\"li4\">Why math math is irrelevant when it comes to the economy</li> <li class=\"li4\">Where Chinese millionaires want to live</li> <li class=\"li4\">Why residential property investments beat multi-family and commercial</li> <li class=\"li4\">How you can tell if your real estate portfolio is diversified</li> <li class=\"li4\">What's wrong with most real estate gurus' and their promises</li> <li class=\"li4\">much, MUCH more…</li> </ul> <p class=\"p3\">Don't miss Jason's monologue, which leads off this episode. He discusses the recent merger of eLance and oDesk, the scam of life insurance as an investment,why college no longer makes financial sense, and what Steve Jobs told President Obama about creating more jobs.</p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Links:</strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"http://financialsurvivalnetwork.com/\">The Financial Survival Network</a></span><span class=\"s2\"><br /> <a href= \"http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/2692349\"><span class= \"s3\">Check out this episode!</span></a></span></p>",

Denninger was also the founder and CEO of MCSNet in Chicago.</p> <p class=\"p3\">Denninger is a founding contributor to the libertarian-oriented finance blog The Market Ticker, found at <a href=\"http://market-ticker.org/\"><span class= \"s1\">http://market-ticker.org</span></a>. He uses his blog to levy harsh criticism of the criminal element who are wrecking the global financial system. In the aftermath of the March 2008 collapse of Bear Stearns, he founded the website Fed Up USA. He came to national attention for the criticisms of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which he posted on Fed Up USA in September that year. Of special concern to Denninger was the over-the-counter trading of credit default swaps, as well as the high leverage of financial institutions; his objections to the bailout plan stemmed from the fact that it did not address either of these issues. He has also spoken out against high-frequency trading, particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 Flash Crash.</p> <p class=\"p3\">As a publicly outspoken and early member of the Tea Party movement, Denninger is sometimes referred to as a founder. On January the day of President Obama's first inauguration, he published a blog post calling on readers to mail tea bags to the White House and Congress on February 1st, echoing a suggestion by a commenter on one of his earlier blog posts. However, Denninger later expressed concern with the Tea Party movement, specifically that establishment Republicans had hijacked it and perverted its original goals.</p> <p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong><em>* Read more from JasonHartman.com</em></strong></span><span class= \"s3\"><strong><em><br /></em></strong><a href= \"https://www.jasonhartman.com/jason-hartman-thou-shalt-invest-in-quality/\"><span class=\"s4\">Jason Hartman: \"Thou Shalt Invest in Quality.\"</span><span class= \"s5\"><br /></span></a><a href= \"https://www.jasonhartman.com/inflations-low-is-that-a-good-thing/\"><span class=\"s4\">Inflation's Low - Is That a Good Thing?</span></a></span></p>",

Jason Hartman interviews Dennis about his experiences and research on retirees and investing. Dennis is also the author of the weekly newsletter Millers Money which has over 150,000 subscribers. Dennis surveyed his readers about how much inflation is a reality in their lives. Over 3,000 people responded and the results were staggering. The reality is that retirees living off a fixed income know EXACTLY how much the price of basic necessities have gone up. They can not only tell you exactly how much the price went up, they can tell you how much the packaging has downsized and how the quality has diminished. Dennis has tapped into the real fear faced by retirees. These three columns that came out of the results really sum up how the government inflation numbers are not a true reflection of how retirees live their lives which is why they seem to be feeling inflation to a greater extent.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> •             Only 1.6% thought inflation was 1 – 2%</p> <p class=\"p1\"> •             14.2% of readers thought inflation was 3 – 5% for them</p> <p class=\"p1\"> •             34.9% thought inflation was 6 – 8% for them</p> <p class=\"p1\"> •             25.7% thought inflation was 9 – 10% for them</p> <p class=\"p1\"> •             23.6% thought inflation was over 11% for them</p> <p class=\"p1\">For more details, visit www.JasonHartman.com.</p> <p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/2377060\">Check out this episode</a></span></p>",

He says this is definitely a recovery time in the housing markets, although there are some markets that are investor driven that may not last. One red flag still hovering is the upcoming large foreclosure wave in certain markets around the U.S. Jed also shares where consumers are looking hardest, such as the western part of the country and suburbs. There are some urban neighborhoods experiencing growth, but there is still more population growth and interest in suburban neighborhoods. Jed and Jason also discuss seasonal patterns of buying and selling.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Jed Kolko, Chief Economist and VP of Analytics, oversees Trulia's research programs.

People are primarily visual learners and Carl found that as he made the concepts visual, it was easier to communicate them to others effectively.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He shares some of these visualizations, such as the market cycles, explaining the terms he uses and the psychology behind the buy/sell behaviors in the stock market. Using a Venn diagram, he is able to help people realize what they have control over and what they don’t, whether it’s investments or business, and enabling them to make better decisions and simplify their financial life.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl became an accidental artist with his simple sketches that make complex financial concepts easy to understand for thousands of people every week on The New York Times Bucks blog. Richards’ art had its first showing at the Kimball Art Center, in Park City, Utah. His commissioned work is on display in businesses and educational institutions across the country.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His sketches also serve as the foundation for his first book, <em>The Behavior Gap: Simple Ways to Stop Doing Dumb Things with Money</em> (Portfolio/Penguin). Carl has appeared regularly on American Public Media's Marketplace Money, writes a column for Morningstar Advisor, and keynotes financial planning conferences and visual learning events. You can find more of his writing and sketches at BehaviorGap.com. A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, Carl is also the director of investor education at BAM Advisor Services and lives in Park City, Utah, with his family.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a financial planner, Carl Richards grew frustrated watching people he cared about make the same mistakes over and over with their money. They were letting emotion get in the way of making smart financial decisions. He named this phenomenon—the distance between what we should do and what we actually do— “the behavior gap.” A quote from his book states, “It’s not that we’re dumb. We’re wired to avoid pain and pursue pleasure and security. It feels right to sell when everyone around us is scared and buy when everyone feels great. It may feel right—but it’s not rational.”</span></p>",

He states there is more incentive in government to do the wrong thing than what is actually best for our country and its citizens. FreedomWorks’ aggressive, real-time campaigns activate a growing and permanent volunteer grassroots army to show up and demand policy change. They believe individual liberty and the freedom to compete increases consumer choices and provides individuals with the greatest control over what they own and earn. They lead the fight for lower taxes, less government, and more freedom.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dean Clancy is FreedomWorks’ Legislative Counsel and Vice President, Health Care Policy. He leads our efforts to reverse the government takeover of health care and adopt a patient-centered approach. Clancy has served as the top White House budget official on health care, Medicare, Social Security, and other major government spending programs; as executive director of the President’s Council on Bioethics; and as a senior policy advisor to the congressional leadership. </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Clancy boasts an impressive resume a deep expertise on a broad range of domestic and fiscal policy subjects.

Here to talk about this subject with Jason Hartman is David Carey, author of King of Capital, and senior writer for “The Deal.” David explains the various forms, including injecting money into companies to help them grow faster, and the most common form, a leverage buyout (LBO).</span></p> <p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In an LBO, private equity firms are not responsible for paying down the debt, unlike a homeowner who pays off a mortgage. Instead, the company that is being acquired takes on the debt and retires it over time using its own cash flow. David notes that most private equity firms outperform stocks and bonds by a wide margin, not just through the use of leverage, but also from improving the profitability of the companies they acquire. David goes on to share his thoughts on the attacks on private equity, Bing Capital and Mitt Romney.</span></p> <p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Dispelling the political negative caricature of the private equity business, David shares how these firms have helped numerous companies prosper, allowing for quicker new job growth. Bing Capital was an exception, having piled on too much debt, and naturally, the Obama campaign took a potshot at the firm and private equity firms in general.</span></p> <p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DAVID CAREY is senior writer for The Deal, a news service and magazine covering private-equity and mergers and acquisitions. Before joining The Deal, he was the editor of Corporate Finance magazine and wrote for Adweek, Fortune, Institutional Investor, and Financial World. Carey has appeared often on CNBC. He holds two masters degrees: one in French literature from Princeton and a second in journalism from Columbia. He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Washington.</span></p> <p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carey authored the book, KING OF CAPITAL: The Remarkable Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone (Crown Business; October 2010), which tells how Schwarzman and his co-founder Pete Peterson, starting with just one secretary in 1985, built a powerhouse that weathered the financial crisis successfully even as other institutions crumbled.
