            "description": "This week I’m thrilled to speak with a woman whose work I’ve followed for years.<br /><br />Martha Beck, PhD, is a New York Times bestselling author, life coach, speaker, and holds three degrees from Harvard University. Oprah calls her “one of the smartest women I know.” Martha walked away from the religious Mormon community she was raised in, exposed her father, and wrote about the dark secrets and hypocrisy of the Mormon church in her book Leaving the Saints. She received backlash from the church, but in the process, found her true, whole self.<br /><br />In this episode, Martha and I discuss why the intellect is important, but a deeper connection to nature and with our own souls is what the world truly needs. You’ll learn how breaking away from cultural rules brings us into alignment with our true selves, and we become whole, healthy, connected individuals full of integrity. <br /><br />This is a beautiful conversation heroine, one of the top interviews in all my years of doing the show. <br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- Martha on being raised as Mormon royalty due to his father’s “scholarly” work.<br />- Discovering the hypocrisy surrounding certain religious people, including her father.<br />- The intense experience of leaving the church and, with that, her family, friends, and culture.<br />- How she got the courage to confront the deep religious conditioning she grew up in.<br />- The crossroads experience of her pregnancy with her Down’s syndrome boy, Adam.<br />- Hear why Martha felt like she needed to unlearn everything that she was taught at Harvard.<br />- Why caring for a fragile life is the most-needed skill in the world right now.<br />- The restrictive good girl archetype as a socially constructed self for many women.<br />- Distinguishing between the essential self that is natural and the social self that is cultural.<br />- The split that happens when people believe things that are contrary to their essential self.<br />- Understanding that finding and claiming your true nature does not come without opposition.<br />- Withstanding backlash, the role of shame, and grieving the loss of cultural connection.<br />- Why, for Martha, life coaching is such a powerful, necessary tool for society.<br />- What the flip side of the Drama Triangle means for persecutors, victims, and rescuers.<br />- How wayfinding can help us discover our deeper purpose and navigate through the chaos.<br />- Find out how existing in alignment with your true nature brings you closer to the supernatural. <br />- The magic of the written word when we write from a powerful connection to truth.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Martha Beck - <a href=\"https://marthabeck.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://marthabeck.com/</a><br />Martha Beck on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marthabeck/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/marthabeck/</a><br />Diana, Herself: An Allegory of Awakening - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Diana-Herself-Awakening-Bewilderment-Chronicles/dp/1944264000\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Diana-Herself-Awakening-Bewilderment-Chronicles/dp/1944264000</a><br />Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith USA Today - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Leaving-Saints-Mormons-Found-Faith/dp/0307335992\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Leaving-Saints-Mormons-Found-Faith/dp/0307335992</a><br />NPR - <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.npr.org/</a><br />Oprah - <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.oprah.com/index.html</a><br />Esther Perel - <a href=\"https://www.estherperel.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.estherperel.com/</a><br />David Emerald - <a href=\"https://powerofted.com/about-david/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://powerofted.com/about-david/</a><br />Stanford University - <a href=\"https://www.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.stanford.edu/</a><br />Harvard University - <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.harvard.edu/</a><br />J.K.

This episode is for you, heroine.<br /><br />Bestselling author and founder of The Work, my guest Byron Katie shares her experience waking up in a state of joy after a decade-long spiral into depression, rage, and self-loathing. This state of joy hasn’t left her since, and Byron has shared this transformational practice with others for over 30 years. The Work is a simple, yet powerful process of inquiry that teaches us to identify and question the thoughts that cause us suffering.<br /><br />In this episode, Byron and I discuss her battle with depression, and the moment of her awakening (which she credits to a cockroach). She explains the principles of The Work, and the four key questions we need to ask in order to change our beliefs. This episode is filled with practical, simple steps to help you become more conscious of your thoughts and free yourself from suffering. If you feel stuck in your beliefs – about your identity, your work, or your relationships – by the end of this episode, you’ll see a way out by going inward.<br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- Byron’s childhood as a quiet, solitary young girl<br />- Her decade-long experience with depression in her thirties<br />- Byron re-lives the moment of awakening that pivoted her entire life trajectory<br />- How The Work was born<br />- Find out why Byron gives all the credit for her moment of awakening to a cockroach<br />- The types of thoughts that hold us back and the four questions we need to ask them<br />- The importance of uncovering the cause and the reaction to the thoughts we believe<br />- Why intelligence is questioning and freedom is choosing the thoughts we believe<br />- The difference between sitting in the “I know” mind as apposed the “curious” mind<br /><br />References<br /><br />Byron Katie - The Work - <a href=\"https://thework.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://thework.com/</a><br />Byron Katie on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByronKatie\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/ByronKatie</a><br />Byron Katie on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/byron.katie/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/byron.katie/</a><br />Byron Katie on Facebook - <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theworkofbyronkatie\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/theworkofbyronkatie</a><br />A Mind at Home with Itself - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Home-Itself-Asking-Questions/dp/0062651609\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Home-Itself-Asking-Questions/dp/0062651609</a><br />Loving What Is - Four Questions That Can Change Your Life - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Loving-What-Four-Questions-Change/dp/1400045371/ref\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Loving-What-Four-Questions-Change/dp/1400045371/ref</a>=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=loving+what+is&qid=1598781393&sr=8-1<br />A Thousand Names for Joy - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Names-Joy-Living-Harmony/dp/0307339246\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Names-Joy-Living-Harmony/dp/0307339246</a>",

            "description": "Do you ever feel like you don’t fit in, that you’re somehow different from everyone else, or maybe even, that you don’t belong? This week I sit down with Krista Williams and Lindsey Simcik, the co-founders of Almost 30, the top-rated LA-based lifestyle podcast. After meeting in SoulCycle, the two became best friends and soon realized they shared a desire to explore the theme of belonging, both to yourself and others. Almost 30 was born out of these conversations, and while not their original intention, it’s now grown into a full-time business, brand, and community.<br /><br />In our conversation, Krista and Lindsey discuss creating for the pure love of creating, and how money, validation, and recognition fall into line once you’re doing what you love. They share what they’ve discovered about themselves and their relationships as they turned their podcast into a business. Krista and Lindsey show us how to speak your truth with compassion and trust yourself as you pursue what you love.<br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- A glimpse into Krista’s wild and rebellious and Lindsey’s eccentric childhood days.<br />- Krista’s departure from her Catholic roots and why she sees the church as oppressive.<br />- Discovering spirituality and the love of the true source that she felt was “hidden” from her.<br />- Why Catholic school was confusing for Lindsey and how she is revisiting the idea of God.<br />- A word of wisdom about navigating your difference and individuality in the context of a group.<br />- The distinction between fitting in and belonging and how this sentiment is expressed in Almost 30.<br />- How the two women met and the mutual interests that ignited their podcasting journey.<br />- Hear about their creative collaboration, the growth of the business, and the intricacy of the co-founder relationship.<br />- The significant learning opportunities presented by our closest relationships with people.<br />- Female friendships and the importance of responding to others from a place of awareness.<br />- Asking yourself the hard question: do I truly want to create or am I looking for validation?<br />- How social media can hamper your creativity and perpetuate inauthenticity.<br />- From side hustle to booming business and learning that you can make money from doing what you love.<br />- The lessons Almost 30 is teaching them about their relationship with money and boundaries.<br />- How they are reclaiming their gut instinct and speaking their truth with love.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Krista Williams - <a href=\"http://itskrista.co/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://itskrista.co/</a><br />Krista Williams on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itskrista/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/itskrista/</a><br />Krista Williams on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itskrista?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/itskrista?lang=en</a><br />Lindsey Simcik on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lindseysimcik/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/lindseysimcik/?hl=en</a><br />Lindsey Simcik on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindsimss?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/lindsimss?lang=en</a><br />Almost 30 Podcast - <a href=\"https://almost30podcast.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://almost30podcast.com/</a><br />Brené Brown - <a href=\"https://brenebrown.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://brenebrown.com/</a><br />SoulCycle - <a href=\"https://soul-cycle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://soul-cycle.com/</a><br />Break the Good Girl Myth - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/book\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/book</a><br />Majo Molfino - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/</a><br />HEROINE (Podcast) - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/podcast</a>",

            "description": "What is your relationship to failure?<br /><br />My guest this week, Sophia Amoruso, believes that, as long as you’re learning from your experiences, there’s no such thing as failure. The founder of Girlboss Media and author of #GIRLBOSS, Sophia watched her first business, online fashion retailer Nasty Gal, go bankrupt after a successful run.

            "description": "Do you find yourself thinking that you want to have and do it all in life: a career, relationship, kids, fitness, money, home? Randi Zuckerberg, my guest this week, certainly does it all — she’s an entrepreneur, investor, bestselling author, tech media personality, and occasional Broadway performer. Behind that impressive resumé is a woman who understands that you can do it all — but not all in one day or even one season of life. She believes you can do everything you want to do, but over a long period of time. <br /><br />After Harvard rejected her for the music program, Randi set aside her love of music to pursue a degree in psychology, followed by a career in technology, which ultimately led to her role as Director of Market Development at Facebook. Years after she thought she’d left music behind, Broadway came calling, and Randi lived her lifelong dream of performing.<br /><br />In this interview, Randi shares the philosophy behind “Pick Three,” and how she’s incorporated this idea when choosing what to focus on in her life. We discuss how to adopt a beginner’s mindset when trying new things, and not giving up on your dreams, even if the path to get there seems hidden.<br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- Growing up with a girls-can-do-anything mentality and oblivious to the glass ceiling.<br />- Her early exposure to technology and how it impacts the work she does with girls today.<br />- Why Randi ended up studying psychology despite her passion for music and performance.<br />- The sobering shift from working in an ad agency with women in leadership to Silicon Valley.<br />- The observations in Silicon Valley that made Randi aware of the glass ceiling at age 22.<br />- Reaching out to female peers outside of the tech industry to create a network of support.<br />- Giving her brother free digital marketing advice before being recruited by Facebook.<br />- The dangers of online anonymity and why Randi feels so strongly about protecting kids.<br />- How Randi’s music dream circled back to her when she got a call from a Broadway producer.<br />- Bridging the worlds of arts, entertainment, and tech, and why it’s becoming increasingly important.<br />- The pros and cons of having such a large spectrum of focus areas under Zuckerberg Media. <br />- A willingness to learn and other strategies for becoming a fearless leader.<br />- A brilliant—yet realistic—perspective on achieving a work-life balance in the long run.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Randi Zuckerberg on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/randizuckerberg\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/randizuckerberg</a><br />Randi Zuckerberg on LinkedIn -  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/randizuckerberg\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/randizuckerberg</a><br />Zuckerberg Media - <a href=\"https://www.zuckerbergmedia.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.zuckerbergmedia.com</a><br />Harvard University - <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.harvard.edu</a><br />Tina Turner - <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/musician/tina-turner\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.biography.com/musician/tina-turner</a><br />Ogilvy - <a href=\"https://www.ogilvy.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ogilvy.com</a><br />Pick Three - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pick-Three-Have-Just-Every/dp/006284282X\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Pick-Three-Have-Just-Every/dp/006284282X</a><br />Break the Good Girl Myth - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Break-Good-Girl-Myth-Purposeful-ebook/dp/B081NH1KJC\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Break-Good-Girl-Myth-Purposeful-ebook/dp/B081NH1KJC</a><br />Majo Molfino - <a href=\"http://majomolfino.com\" rel=\"noopener\">http://majomolfino.com</a><br />HEROINE (Podcast) - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/podcast</a>",

            "description": "When’s the last time you expressed vulnerability through your creativity? For Brit Morin, my guest on this week’s episode, it’s part of her every day life. Brit founded her lifestyle and online learning platform, Brit + Co, to help women connect with and express their creative spirit. With an engaged community of 125+ million women and over 200,000 online class enrollments, Brit + Co is the leading destination for learning and discovery among female millennials. She launched her business at the age of 25, and learned how to balance motherhood alongside her career as a creative entrepreneur.<br /><br />In this episode, Brit discusses how to empower and equip your employees by letting go of control, and how she brings her authentic self into her brand. She shares the power of believing in yourself and your creativity, even in the face of criticism. Trying new, creative things feels vulnerable and scary, because we’re afraid to fail. Brit shows us that, while we may fail and everything won’t be perfect, we can learn how to be resilient and keep creating anyway. <br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- How Brit saw her inner creativity evolve through childhood and adolescence.<br />- Why she decided to leave her job at Google to launch Brit + Co at 25.<br />- What it was like for Brit meeting her husband at 19.<br />- Brit’s highs and lows with Brit + Co.<br />- What is was like to have to lay off members of her team after Facebook algorithm changes. <br />- Having a decentralized team means Brit + Co hasn’t taken a hit during quarantine.<br />- Letting go of control and finding balance as an entrepreneur.<br />- Brit’s ‘North Star’ when her motivation is low.<br />- How creativity can equate to courage.<br />- Ways that Brit pushed through some of her own insecurities.<br />- The Private/Public Divide and how Brit decides where the boundaries are.<br />- Dealing with criticism and juggling motherhood and career.<br />- How Brit has managed to lessen some of the demand that she puts on herself.<br />- What Brit is reclaiming for herself in her journey of personal growth.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Brit + Co - <a href=\"https://www.brit.co\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.brit.co</a><br />Brit Morin on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brit\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/brit</a><br />Brit Morin on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brit\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/brit</a><br />Brit + Co on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/BritandCo\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/BritandCo</a><br />Teach Me Something New with Brit Morin - <a href=\"https://www.brit.co/teach-me-something-new-podcast\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.brit.co/teach-me-something-new-podcast</a>",

Growing up in a mainly white Midwestern suburb, the twins relied on each other for companionship throughout their childhood. Coco and Breezy developed a unique fashion sense that set them apart from other kids, and experienced bullying and exclusion while in school. Rather than allow the bullying to keep them down, the twins used it to inspire their love for stylish eyewear. They sold their first pairs of glasses on Myspace, where they built an extensive following. By the time the twins turned 17, they held three jobs to support their family.<br /><br />In this inspiring interview, Coco and Breezy share their early lessons in entrepreneurship. Through their own personal examples, we learn why failure is necessary, and how we even should embrace failure as an opportunity for growth.<br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- Coco and Breezy share stories from their creative, active, curious childhood and what it’s like to grow up with a twin<br />- How they had to assimilate to whiteness growing up in a mostly white Midwestern suburb<br />- Being bullied, left out, misunderstood, and without a community meant the twins had only each other to rely on during their school years<br />- The bullying they experienced in school inspired their love for eyewear<br />- The twins posted photos of their unique, stylish outfits on Myspace and created a community of followers online<br />- Working three jobs by the age of 17 to support their family<br />- Making their first eyewear sales through Myspace, and then traveling to New York wearing their creations<br />- The twins share difficult lessons they learned in their early years of entrepreneurship<br />- How they feel excited by the opportunity to solve a challenge because it pushes them out of their comfort zones<br />- After spending the last of their money on a defective order, they saw the chance to make changes in their lives and business<br />- Learning how to run a more efficient business as two individuals, rather than as one person<br />- Why failure is necessary and something we all experience, especially if we’re willing to get uncomfortable<br /><br />References<br /><br />Coco & Breezy - <a href=\"https://cocoandbreezy.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://cocoandbreezy.com</a><br />Coco & Breezy on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cocoandbreezy\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/cocoandbreezy</a><br />Coco & Breezy Eyewear - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cocoandbreezyeyewear\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/cocoandbreezyeyewear</a><br />Break the Good Girl Myth - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/book\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/book</a>",

            "description": "When you’re faced with a new opportunity in your career, do you evaluate that opportunity based on the potential for growth it provides? My guest this week has used this measure throughout her career, and as a result, she takes career opportunities where she learns, grows, and adds value. <br /><br />Elise Loehnen Fissmer is the Chief Content Officer of goop, the lifestyle and e-commerce company established by Gwyneth Paltrow in 2008. Prior to joining goop, Elise worked for Condé Nast and Shopzilla, where she adopted a mindset that helped her design a career and life aligned to her purpose.<br /><br />In this interview, Elise tells us of her career progression from recent Yale graduate freelancing at Lucky Magazine, to the opportunity at Shopzilla she pursued because of the tremendous learning potential that came with it. She discusses her early days at goop, when she found herself more hands-on with the team. Recognizing her own comfort with staying behind-the-scenes, Elise now challenges herself to grow by taking on external facing opportunities to contribute. In this episode, you’ll learn about the importance of prototyping ideas you want to try, and Elise shares the questions to ask when considering how new career opportunities align with your purpose. <br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- Get a glimpse of Elise’s childhood: horses, making jewelry, and attending hippy school.<br />- Comforting her inner child and speaking to her anxieties around money and security.<br />- Hear about Elise’s middle school years as a competitive athlete, mathlete, an artist.<br />- The period of desperation after graduating from Yale during a time of job market uncertainty.<br />- How landing a freelance job at Lucky Magazine became her doorway to the media industry.<br />- Find out what Elise did in the period between working for Lucky and getting hired by goop.<br />- Why you should work for the company that will teach you what you want to know.<br />- Learning early on that waiting to be scouted, discovered, and invited was unrealistic.<br />- How goop started as a newsletter in 2008 and the organic way that Gwyneth scaled it.<br />- Goop’s approach to business: prototyping, experimenting, playing, collaborating.<br />- Beginner’s resistance and imposter syndrome and why women excel at conquering them.<br />- How Elise’s role has transitioned from managing to being an individual contributor.<br />- Learn what the Netflix series the goop lab is all about and the edgy topics they cover.<br />- The cycle of backlash that ensues every time goop does something expansive.<br />- Thoughts about why people tend to defend the status quo and how it relates to authority.<br />- The creative dream of writing a book instead of only ever co-authoring.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Elise Loehnen - <a href=\"http://www.eliseloehnen.com\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.eliseloehnen.com</a><br />Elise Loehnen on LinkedIn - <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-loehnen-b867523\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-loehnen-b867523</a><br />Elise Loehnen on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eloehnen\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/eloehnen</a><br />Yale - <a href=\"https://www.yale.edu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.yale.edu</a><br />Shopzilla - <a href=\"http://www.shopzilla.com\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.shopzilla.com</a><br />goop - <a href=\"https://goop.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://goop.com</a><br />Condé Nast - <a href=\"https://www.condenast.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.condenast.com</a><br />Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gwynethpaltrow\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/gwynethpaltrow</a><br />Who’s Afraid of Gwyneth Paltrow and goop? - <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/opinion/goop-gwyneth-paltrow-netflix.html\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/opinion/goop-gwyneth-paltrow-netflix.html</a><br />the goop lab - <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/za/title/80244690\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.netflix.com/za/title/80244690</a><br />Break the Good Girl Myth - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Break-Good-Girl-Myth-Purposeful-ebook/dp/B081NH1KJC\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Break-Good-Girl-Myth-Purposeful-ebook/dp/B081NH1KJC</a><br />Majo Molfino - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com</a><br />HEROINE (Podcast) - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/podcast</a>",

            "description": "Have you ever been faced with this choice: remain obedient to your family by giving up your dreams, or pursue your heart’s passion, against your family’s wishes? My guest on HEROINE this week faced that exact situation. Rana el Kaliouby, PhD, Egyptian-American computer scientist and CEO, knew her patriarchal Middle Eastern culture required her to make sacrifices she wasn’t willing to make. After studying computer science and receiving her PhD at Cambridge, Rana developed a deep passion to bring emotional intelligence (EQ) into technology. While founding her company, Affectiva, she chose to leave her marriage, rather than give up on the work she believed in so deeply. Rana recently released her first book, Girl Decoded, a memoir about her life as a rule breaker. <br /><br />In this episode, Rana takes us through her childhood in the Middle East, raised in a family of technologists with strict gender roles. While she wasn’t used to vulnerability or emotion growing up, Rana discusses her personal journey in dealing with emotionally complex situations throughout her life. We also learn about the importance of following your convictions, even if they don’t align with others’ expectations. Rana teaches us when disobedience is necessary, and how to keep yourself out of your own way in the pursuit of your dreams. <br /><br />Show Notes<br /><br />- Rana’s childhood growing up in the Middle East.<br />- The influence of Rana’s technologist family, with two programmer parents.<br />- How Rana creatively rebelled against her father’s patriarchal ways.<br />- The influence the mixture of a forward-thinking but conservative family had on Rana.<br />- How Rana’s family suppressed emotions about evacuating Kuwait after it got invaded by Iraq.<br />- The story of why Rana’s dad got angry with her while she was studying computer science.<br />- Rana’s dream to build technology that can capture non-verbal communication signals.<br />- How Rana realized that building EQ into technology was her calling.<br />- What EQ in technology can offer and how this vision helped Rana disobey conventions.<br />- The story of how Rana had to prioritize starting Affectiva to the detriment of her marriage.<br />- Having to become a disobedient daughter in order to become a powerful woman.<br />- How Rana overcame her self-imposed barriers to become CEO of Affectiva.<br />- Rana’s use of journaling to externalize and process her feelings.<br />- Being a mother amongst all of the career challenges Rana faced.<br />- Why Rana has decided to lead with empathy.<br />- One thing Rana is reclaiming and hopes her book does.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Rana el Kaliouby - <a href=\"https://ranaelkaliouby.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ranaelkaliouby.com</a><br />Girl Decoded - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Decoded-Scientists-Intelligence-Technology-ebook/dp/B07VF1SKPV\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Decoded-Scientists-Intelligence-Technology-ebook/dp/B07VF1SKPV</a><br />Affectiva - <a href=\"https://www.affectiva.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.affectiva.com</a><br />The American University in Cairo - <a href=\"https://www.aucegypt.edu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.aucegypt.edu</a><br />Alexa - <a href=\"https://alexa.amazon.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alexa.amazon.com</a><br />Siri - <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/siri\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.apple.com/siri</a><br />Affective Computing - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Affective-Computing-Press-Rosalind-Picard/dp/0262661152\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Affective-Computing-Press-Rosalind-Picard/dp/0262661152</a><br />Untamed - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Untamed-Glennon-Doyle-Melton/dp/1984801252\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Untamed-Glennon-Doyle-Melton/dp/1984801252</a><br />Ariana Huffington - <a href=\"http://ariannahuffington.com\" rel=\"noopener\">http://ariannahuffington.com</a>",

            "description": "Do you ever wonder how your skills and experience could lead you to your higher purpose? Amy Yeung’s soul journey from corporate fashion designer to social entrepreneur shows that inside each of us lies the ability to create positive change in the world. Owner of the Orenda Tribe lifestyle brand, Amy lives and works with artisans in the Navajo community to create upcycled clothing and share indigenous culture.<br /><br />Growing up in rural Indiana, with her Native American heritage and obsession with fashion, Amy felt like an outsider. When she moved to New York to pursue her career in fashion, she knew she’d found her path and never looked back. <br /><br />As a mother, Amy desired to leave a legacy focused on sustainable design and solving the social problems plaguing her native community. She left her corporate job behind and retraced her family history back to the Navajo reservation of her birth, where her studio is now based. <br />In this episode, Amy models reconnecting with ourselves by connecting with the land, sky, and water. She shows us that, while we can step into our true calling at any point in life, the best time to align with your greater purpose is right now.<br /><br />Show Notes<br />- Learn about Amy’s Diné heritage and growing up in a small rural town in Indiana. <br />- The historical context that played into her mother’s decision to have her adopted.  <br />- The difficulty of trying to translate your passion into a career in a community that is unlike you. <br />- Feeling like an outsider as a Native American artsy kid who made her own clothes. <br />- Starting with studies in pharmacy before convincing her parents to let her apply for fashion. <br />- The sink-or-swim experience of moving to New York and creating a life there. <br />- Ascribing her success to a deep understanding of being loved by her parents.<br />- How motherhood made her more community-oriented and invested in sustainable design.<br />- Responding to the call to consciousness by turning her back on the corporate measures of success. <br />- Rethink, revive, rebirth, and other re-words that form the foundation of Orenda Tribe.<br />- Learning about environment genocide, fracking, and other problems on her journey of reintegrating with her tribe.<br />- Advice for crafting the life you want: simplify, eliminate the noise, and connect to the earth. <br />- How the meditative processes in indigenous cultures brings us closer to ourselves.<br />- Reclaiming her ancestry, learning about the native community, and educating others.<br />- Find out which Navajo community service projects Amy is currently working on. <br /><br />References<br />Amy Yeung on LinkedIn - <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyyeung/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyyeung/</a><br />Amy Yeung on Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lilacreative/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/lilacreative/</a><br />Orenda Tribe - <a href=\"https://www.orendatribe.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.orendatribe.com/</a><br />Inc.  - <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/leigh-buchanan/orenda-tribe-amy-yeung-navajo-reservation-albuquerque-new-mexico-main-street.html\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.inc.com/leigh-buchanan/orenda-tribe-amy-yeung-navajo-reservation-albuquerque-new-mexico-main-street.html</a><br />Majo Molfino - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/</a><br />HEROINE (Podcast) - <a href=\"https://majomolfino.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener\">https://majomolfino.com/podcast</a>",

            "description": "I’ve asked many of you a simple question: Have you thought about striking out on your own and starting your own business (freelance, studio, consulting, coaching, company, startup, etc.) in the future? About 98% of you say yes.  So, then comes the follow-up question: Well, how come you haven’t started today?<br /><br />What do you think is the most common response? While there are many excuses around readiness, and enjoying the stability, prestige, and recognition of your current job, the most common reason you haven’t started: you’re waiting for clarity.  Some  “I don’t know’s” that are stalling you:  I don’t know where to focus, I don’t know which interests to pursue first, I don’t know where or how to begin, I don’t know where my strengths lie, and I don’t know if this can make money. <br /><br />What are the strategies you’ve used to gain clarity? Here are some I’ve heard:<br /><br />Journaling<br /><br />More trainings<br /><br />Meditation<br /><br />Vision boarding<br /><br />Conversations<br /><br />Retreats<br /><br />Nothing, just waiting!<br /><br />Now, these are all lovely and needed strategies, but they’re far, far too passive. Sorry. You need a little fire under your butt. A little pep in your step. A little sprinkle on your latte (too much?).<br /><br />The good news is there is a method to this ambiguous madness. Designers (inventors, creatives, scientists!) have been using a method for a very long time. <br /><br />Designers know that clarity doesn’t come from waiting, it comes from making. <br /><br />What if you could define a project for yourself, and break it into prototypes you can test, in order to get clarity about whether it’s the direction you want, and in order to course-correct from there? <br /><br />Clarity comes from taking action first. You start with action. And the most powerful action you can take is to make something, throw it at someone, and see how they react. <br /><br />Now, even prototyping and testing has its fair share of vulnerability involved, doesn’t it? What if people judge you? What if you are the laughing stock of the whole class as you run around naked in that nightmare which has now become real life? That’s why in order to move into this approach, we also need to strengthen our creative confidence muscle (by learning how to manage fear and resistance). <br /><br />It’s the combination of understanding our resistance (e.g., doing the inner work) with the actual, making and testing of our ideas (e.g., doing the outer work) that will get us results.<br /><br />I’m really excited to personally invite you to my second pilot of IGNITE – a 12-week program that supports female leaders in defining, testing, and ultimately sharing their creative ideas and gifts with the world while working full-time. You don’t need to quit your day job, take on a huge financial risk, or make a crazy career pivot to design your purpose. By sharing your gifts, you design your unique creative purpose and translate that into actionable steps in your career.  <br /><br />IGNITE IS FOR...<br />A female, creative professional<br /><br />A leader such as a manager, lead, director, or executive<br /><br />Between the ages of 28 - 40 <br /><br />Someone who wants to make a difference and have an impact<br /><br />An empathic woman who cares deeply for others and the world <br /><br />Someone who is willing to invest time and money into up-leveling themselves<br /><br />IT’S NOT FOR...<br />A founder or entrepreneur already engaged in your creative purpose<br /><br />A coach<br /><br />A college or graduate student<br /><br />Someone who is not working (e.g., unemployed)<br /><br />Someone who thinks personal growth is too “woo woo”<br /><br />Someone who isn’t willing to put in the work and take action to design a better life <br /><br />WHAT WILL WE DO?<br />Stage 1: Lose Good Girl & Fear Mentality (CLEAR)<br /><br />In this stage, we clear good girl mentality, fears, and excuses and replace them with new, empowering beliefs that you can carry forward into your life. Inner work and self-discovery is the foundation. <br /><br />Outcome: A unique Creative Badass Daily Ritual (CBDR) tailored to you so that you can reprogram any negative, fear-based beliefs about sharing your gifts through daily guided meditations, affirmations, and mantras throughout the program.<br /><br />Stage 2: Design Your Creative Purpose Project (CPP) (DESIGN)<br /><br />Here we design and define a timeline, three prototypes, and final launch date for a project that is rooted in your creative purpose (what I’ll call your “Creative Purpose Project”) based on the self-discovery above.<br /><br />Outcome: A CPP Brief which includes a timeline, launch date, and three increasingly challenging prototypes that encapsulate your creative purpose. <br /><br />Stage 3: Ignite Your Creative Purpose Project (IGNITE)<br /><br />In this final stage, we test our ideas with real people, get feedback, launch our CPP, and build our creative confidence. We gain clarity from ACTION.<br /><br />Outcome: New insights from putting your CPP into practice resulting in the formulation of a 12-month Creative Purpose Plan to take beyond the program, including your aspirational Creative Legacy Statement (e.g., “North Star”) you can carry forward.<br /><br />The 12-week journey<br /><br />Week 1: Setting Up for Success <br /><br />Week 2: Identify Fears & Excuses<br /><br />Week 3: Reprogram Fears & Excuses<br /><br />Week 4: Define Prototypes & Launch<br /><br />Week 5: Finalize Your CPP Brief <br /><br />Week 6: Run Prototype 1<br /><br />Week 7: Run Prototype 2<br /><br />Week 8: Run Prototype 3<br /><br />Week 9: Prototype Analysis & Prep for Final<br /><br />Week 10: Final Launch <br /><br />Week 11: Debrief<br /><br />Week 12: Design 12-Month Career Action Plan<br /><br />FORMAT<br />A weekly group coaching call <br /><br />12 weeks <br /><br />A curriculum & training with weekly assignments  <br /><br />Communication and mentorship between sessions (e.g., Slack)<br /><br />For many years, I’ve guided private clients through this journey and am excited to offer it for the first time in a group format.<br /><br />If you’re curious to learn more and are ready to take action, then sign up for a free Creative Purpose Design Session by heading to my website- Majo.co and clicking Let's Chat (limited spots, available next week only) to experience some of this process. <br /><br />Let’s go!<br /><br />Excited to connect with you.",

            "description": "Hi Heroine,<br /><br />Imagine you worked so hard building a startup you really believed in and then it crashed. Would you keep going until you succeeded or give up?<br /><br />My guest today is Vanessa Larco who decided to keep going. When regulatory changes killed her startup she fled to Greece for two weeks, to swear off Silicon Valley forever. <br /><br />That’s when people there assumed, in her sad state, that she was a bride who had been left by a man at the altar – a wake-up call that lead her to stop mopping around and return the world of product and startups, which eventually lead her to receive an unexpected offer to become partner at a top venture capital firm, NEA. In fact, Vanessa is now one of the few female, Latina investors in Silicon Valley, which is a big deal. <br /><br />Women of color are the fastest-growing sector of the entrepreneurial market but they receive less than 2% of the capital because 99% of venture capitalists are men, particularly white men. There are so many products and services that never have a chance to get off of the ground because of the lack of diversity in this sector, which is why we need smart women like Vanessa on the inside. <br /><br /> <br />HIGHLIGHTED EXCERPT:<br /><br />Vanessa: I never thought I would be here.<br /><br />Majo: It sounds like it. Now, Vanessa, I know there are some listeners who might be thinking like “I could’ve never taken that role and would’ve felt like such an impostor”. Did you feel that or like you could learn it?<br /><br />Vanessa:  Every job I’ve had, I’ve had major impostor syndrome and tons of anxiety, to be honest. I look back and realize I figured out a lot of things and there’s a lot of things I didn’t figure it out but I learned a ton in a very short amount of time. I’ve kinda just made peace with the impostor syndrome. I don’t think it ever goes away. I just think that now I’m aware of it and have the confidence in myself to be able to embrace it.",

She gets really real and vulnerable so grab your favorite tea and settle in.<br /><br />Her story so clearly shows the heroine’s journey from the dark hopelessness of being told she couldn’t succeed, that her sister was the talented one. The only time her parents paid attention to her was to complain about each other. Even after having been dropped by two record labels she refused to give up. <br /><br />Instead, she was scrappy and figured out how to create contacts with the people choosing music for television, movies, and advertisements. In her twenties, she managed to build a business making multi-six-figures a year and ended up running an online school to help other creatives do the same. <br /><br />She wrote an incredible book that comes out November 12th so make sure to snag a copy of Don’t Keep Your Day Job which talks about designing a way to contribute to the world that is personal and relevant to YOU. <br /><br />Her perspective of purpose being the opposite of depression has helped thousands understand that as humans, we are happiest when we are contributing to other people. <br /><br />HIGHLIGHTED EXCERPT<br /><br />Cathy: What I did have was a cautionary tale. I had two parents who were miserable and a mom who didn't want to be here anymore with 911 calls and suicide hotline calls from her. So that was the driving force of “Oh I will not put my dreams on the back burner because it doesn't work. And I will not be invisible anymore or else I will be broken forever. So I have to do this. My life depends on it”.<br /><br />Majo: So, you decide to move to Las Angeles to pursue a career in music. And at this point are you writing your own songs?<br /><br />Cathy: Not really, maybe a couple, like I started right around then. I came out here and started to ask questions like  “How do you get a record deal?” and I thought that was the only way to make a living was to get a record deal. I just started trying to figure out how to do it. My husband says I have the will of a small country like if I'm going to do something I commit. I ended up getting a record deal at Interscope and it was amazing. I remember being like “OMG! I’m here.” I was actually sitting with Lady Gaga at Sunset Sounds, which is a recording studio. She was recording Paparazzi and I had just gotten signed. I couldn't believe it; they were asking me like what kind of coffee I wanted and I was like “Wow, I'm the next person to record a record.” And then I got dropped from the label about three months later.",

            "datePublished": "Thu, 31 Oct 2019 11:00:18 +0000",
            "description": "Happy Halloween witches! We’re continuing with female archetypes (and stereotypes!) in old fairy and folk tales. We started with this series last season with the Queen and Princess Archetypes (make sure to check them out if you haven't already for context) and this is the last part of that series.  <br /><br />Today, on the witch’s new year – Samhain, we are going to look at the witch and the hermit archetypes. They’re more connected than you might think.<br /><br />The witch needs very little introduction. She is in practically every fairy tale by the Grimm Brothers. She’s cruel, conniving, solitary and sometimes, connected to the evilest forces in the world. And in 1692, life imitated art in a big way. An entire community of settlers in Salem, Massachusetts decided that witches were real, and needed to be killed. <br /><br />But where did this idea come from? <br /><br />I caught up with my friend Becca Piastrelli to learn a bit more about how witches got the reputation they have today. Becca is the host of the Belonging Podcast and she and I have been circling on the new moon for years now.<br /><br />\"It’s a campaign that’s happened for centuries, many generations from basically the rise of Christianity and capitalism in Europe that specifically targeted women who were healers, and midwives and really powerful beings in the community. Ones that people respected and looked up to, maybe they even owned land. And it wasn’t just women, sometimes it was queer men or two-spirit or genderfluid folk. Anyone who didn’t fit the patriarchal paradigm. <br /><br />There was a very calculated campaign to turn the people against them in their earth ways. This is known as the burning time which in many ways is still happening today. Where you hear the term witch hunt in media or popular culture or even see how it’s displayed in media. It’s really something that has been embedded in our ancestral memory for many many generations. \"<br /><br /><br />As Christianity grew across Europe, the Church demonized these women and connected them to dangerous, evil forces. It was classic scapegoating. Talking to Becca got me thinking about scapegoating, and I realized, there’s a good reason for men to fear us. Women are connected to the Goddess...and to childbirth...and men are not.<br /><br />So how must it have felt - to be a respected, practicing healer and midwife one day - and called an evil witch - the next? That is why I believe when we meet witches in fairy tales, they are often alone. They live in solitude, in the forest - remember, that’s where the medicines were - scheming, angry and isolated. Basically, the happy midwife becomes a resentful hermit. <br /><br />Have you ever felt like a hermit, Heroine, all alone? The Hermit isn’t all bad - not at all. The bright side of the hermit is that she’s also a mystic. She goes into the forest for some much needed alone time - to reconnect with her spiritual side. She goes there to tend to the parts of herself that are precious, and need protection.<br /><br />But the dark side of the Hermit is avoidance and fear. Keeping people out because they might hurt you. It starts as a punishment for those who have wronged you, but ends up mostly, hurting you. <br /><br />I believe this split - between connected, centered, community-surrounded healer, and betrayed, mystical, and isolated witch - must be healed in each of us. <br /><br />Just think - have you ever been passive-aggressive? Have you said something underhanded, but in a nice way, and not understood why you did it? That has to do with the complicated origins of the witch. She wants to fully express herself - thorns and all - but she knows that patriarchy will cast her out and make her quiet if she does.<br /><br /> Well, I want to reclaim the witch archetype within each of us, as so many others have been doing and continue to do today. A witch is creative, she’s complicated, and she’s been to the depths. So whether you’re cooking a large meal and it feels like you’re listening to your grandma tell you a recipe, or you’re listening to your intuition fully, and without judgment, I want you to lean in...to the witch. Hard. Whether you’re a modern witch, with a coven and a spellbook, or just witch-curious, it’s all good. <br /><br /><br />So what about you, Heroine? Do you identify with the witch?<br /><br />A big thank you to Meg Rose who helped score this special Samhain episode!",

            "description": "Hi Heroine, <br /><br />One of the things I’ve been thinking about lately is how the practice of astrology could help me step up as a leader. How could it help me broaden my impact and align with my purpose? And that’s a huge part of what my guest Debra Silverman opens up by applying astrology in a practical way to our lives. Debra holds an M.A. from Antioch University in Clinical Psychology and trained for her mental health credentials at Harvard University. <br /><br />What’s super interesting about astrology is that for thousands of years it was primarily practiced by men but in recent times, we’ve all seen the shift – women practice it far more than men – and Debra has been a driving force in training women to combine both their analytical and intuitive gifts in order to become astrologists. It’s really inspiring to see how she shifted from private practice as a psychologist for over 40 years to building a scalable business and school online that certifies thousands of mostly women. In other words, she’s kicking ass. In this episode, you’re going to learn about the Saturn return (if you don’t know what that is, you’ll so find out) and how much it affects you and your destiny, even if you don’t recognize it at the time.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTED EXCERPT<br /><br />Debra: Don’t underestimate- I wish someone would have told me that if you have a passion, whatever it may be, something that you really pour yourself into- that does come into a reaping cycle eventually. <br /><br />Majo: I want to talk to you about that transition that you made. You were doing private practice as a clinical psychologist and an astrologer for multiple decades. <br /><br />Debra: That’s right, 38 years. <br /><br />Majo: And then you shifted to scaling and in large part because we’re in a special time as well with all the technology and tools. With so much of your business online, tell me a little more about the shift and how that happened. I hear the energetics of it but I'm curious was there particular characters or moments?<br /><br />Debra: Fate showed up and introduced me to Destinee Berman who I now have a meeting with every Monday morning. It’s karmic- fate has a file for each of us and if you open it you can see the destiny lines. So she opened mine and said “Have you ever heard of an online school?” and I didn’t know what she was talking about. She then helped me do a “skinny launch”- just my email list and in that first class there were 40 women and now it’s grown to thousands.",

            "description": "Hi Heroine,<br /><br />Today’s podcast episode is a minisode, where I  share the three elements you need to become creative badass like the women who come onto the show. <br /><br />These elements will be helpful to each and every one of you. But I especially want to invite you to read closely if you are a creative female professional who is a leader at her company, what I mean is you’re in a senior or lead creative role, a manager, director, or executive. As you go into your work day after day, you’ve been asking yourself a few questions such as “Is this all there is?” “What’s next? What’s beyond this?” and “Am I making the most out of my potential?” and my favorite, “Could I start my own fill-in-the-blank” whether that’s a conference, a podcast, a book, a business... <br /><br />Even though you’re kicking ass at work, and you have a ton of responsibility, and you’re achieving and hitting milestones, deep down you feel like something is missing, something key, and you can’t put your finger on it. Of course, you have a ton of ideas of your own...brilliant ideas, and thoughts, and opinions, but you find yourself keeping them under wraps, to yourself, hidden...stowed away.<br /><br />Far too many women with incredibly creative ideas and skills aren’t tapping into them and putting them out into the world, whether it’s their art or creative problem-solving. And it’s painful– on a soul level – to be unexpressed.<br /><br />Think about it. What is the cost to you when you hold back your gifts and leave so much of your potential untapped? It’s a steep price.<br /><br />Funny story I’ve been sharing recently, I used to have to wear sunglasses at my 9-to-5! Yes, I wore sunglasses inside because I was far too sensitive and creative to be put in a cage. As a little girl, I was creative and for many years completely suppressed that part of myself because I became a “good girl” and studied what I thought would be the safe path and what my parents wanted me to do. After a lot of soul searching, I was able to start a six-figure business, launch a podcast where I interview award-winning artists and authors, and land a publishing deal with a top publisher and write a book...I would not have been able to do all that if I was still being a good girl. I made bold, professional moves towards my mission that would change my life and impact other people too. <br /><br />But here’s the thing, like the heroine’s journey, this does not happen overnight. It takes steps. And I want to share with you the three things that women need in order to start on this journey towards owning themselves as creative badasses. <br /><br />Ready?<br /><br />The first is you have to clear. What do I mean by clear? You have to clear out all the negative blocks, fears, and excuses that are getting in the way of sharing your gifts. The one that most just drives me crazy is “It’s not the right time to share my gifts.” Newsflash! If you’re waiting to feel ready, you’ll wait until your deathbed. You have to do the inner work to reprogram your mind to success. <br /><br />The second is you have to design. We do not discover our creative purpose, we actively design it. You need to define a creative purpose project that feels scary enough but not paralyzing. It needs to be something that is going to grow and stretch your creative confidence. This project is the physical embodiment of an idea that you have.<br /><br />The third is you have to ignite. You need to put that project out into the world, in front of people, learn to withstand judgment and feedback, not take it personally and move forward. Practice being seen and heard- this works through quick prototyping and sharing with people you trust.<br /><br />By having these three building blocks: the inner work, the design and the igniting through active prototyping and learning, you are going to be so much closer to being a creative badass than ever before. <br /><br />I’m designing a new program that blends the inner work of self-discovery with the outer work of taking action in the direction of our true, creative purpose. It’s the culmination of multiple years of coaching women. For many years, I’ve guided private clients through this journey and am excited to offer it in a new group format.<br /><br />So, I’m looking for six to ten brave women who want to begin designing and living their creative purpose, and who are curious about working through this process with me. <br /><br />If that’s you, you can sign up for a session (if there are any left) by heading to Majo.co andclicking on “Let’s Chat” in the navigation at the top of the page. <br /><br />*Please read carefully: This program is designed for women who are working full-time as employees at a company and are in a leadership position. It’s not a program for women who are already independent and already entrepreneurs. It’s not a program for women who are job-seeking or in-between jobs. I may offer something for creative entrepreneurs in the future, but that’s not my focus at the moment. So please do not sign up for a session if you are not working at a 9-to-5.<br /><br />Whether that’s you or not, you can still take the first step to becoming a creative badass right now, by taking a free quiz on the homepage of my website, Majo.co,  that is going to help you identify your unique, feminine, creative power and give you one practical action step to channel this power in a way that elevates your leadership. <br /><br />Not only are you going to learn about your creative strength, but based on that new insight, I’m going to give you a recommendation to take action right now. The action step will depend on your unique result, so this quiz will personalize a recommendation specifically for you. <br /><br />Listen, I know you’re tired of not feeling like you’re making the most out of your potential. And I know you don’t want to end up on your deathbed looking back, regretting your career choices. We spend 8 (or more) hours of our day working, and that work should feel meaningfully creative and abundant, and if it isn’t, you’re wasting precious time and precious life force. <br /><br />It should matter to you to feel ALIVE. It matters to the world that you feel ALIVE. The world needs women’s perspectives, voices, and above all, creativity. If you don’t become creatively alive and share your gifts, we’re going to hear from the same people again and again...we’re NOT going to see progress, we’re going to see an imbalance of power, and contributions skewed towards those who talk the loudest and uphold an illusion of separation – separation with ourselves, the planet, and each other. <br /><br />We don’t need or want more of that. We’re in a special time in the world, and we need more women like you activated. Not tomorrow. But today. <br /><br />So head over to my website, Majo.co, and click Let’s Chat in the navigation bar, and/or take the quiz on the homepage to discover your creative, feminine, power.",

            "datePublished": "Thu, 10 Oct 2019 11:00:15 +0000",
            "description": "Have you ever felt like you would like to take the leap into entrepreneurship but you imagined that it might be a lonely place? I speak to a lot of women who want to strike out on their own but feel the desire to be a part of a team as well. Ashley Sumner is helping solve this tension by providing an online and in-person community for female entrepreneurs with her friend Gianna Wurzl.<br /><br />The daughter of parents who both ran their own businesses, Ashley learned very early on the benefits of creating something you’re passionate about. She went to NYU for theatre before realizing what she really loved was connecting people. After working as a romantic matchmaker and later, community builder at companies such as Neuehouse, she met Gianna who had the other half of her idea for Quilt. Now, they bring women together in small groups of 8-10 in homes where they can work, learn, and grow together while exploring the concept of women supporting women.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTED EXCERPT<br /><br />Majo: So it’s more of a mindset shift than an expertise conversation. So it’s like “Hey guys, we all don’t know what we’re doing and that’s okay because we can figure it out together. <br /><br />Ashley: Totally. We learn from stories. So we can get ten women in a room who all have a different story around money but when you hear someone’s story where maybe they’ve gotten themselves out of debt and how they did it. They’re by no means a financial expert but oftentimes those experts have a really hard time coming down to where people are and translating and understanding. So I think we often learn the most from someone who just completed a step right above us or right below us.  A billionaire has no idea how to tell you to save five dollars on a cup of coffee.  So, yeah, peer to peer. <br /><br /> Majo: Peer to peer. I love that.",

In this week’s podcast for the first time in Heroine history my editor, Anne Hoffman, flips the tables and interviews me. It quickly gets raw and real as we dig deep. <br /><br />We talk about everything from loving rubrics in school to how I felt like I was wearing a costume when I worked an outwardly perfect cubicle job at a research organization in D.C. It was so much fun to walk through all the threads that led me to step into my creative purpose as a podcaster, writer, and women’s leadership coach. <br /><br />Highlighted Excerpt<br /><br />Anne: I think your story reflects this story that when you’re twenty or thirty you can’t really write anything because you haven’t lived enough and in your forties is when you write. I know you’re in your thirties but it’s like you did so much living and there’s a way in which, when it happening, you’re like “where is this going”. There are all these disparate experiences but look where it got you. It all sort of culminates in your book.<br /><br />Majo: Creativity is built from inputs. you’re literally taking all these threads from your life and mashing them together to create new things. It’s interesting to take all the threads of who we are and weave them into something.<br /><br />You want to discover your creative purpose? You design it. It’s about looking back …that’s how we live creative purpose, it’s not sitting around and waiting and feeling chronically “not ready yet”…it’s by active design and engagement, and that’s the creative process.  You create your life as much as you create a poem, a short story, a film, a podcast episode… <br /><br />Anne: I think for me and for a lot of other women you are the example of having the confidence to synthesize your experience into art or something greater than the experiences. <br /><br />Discover your creative, feminine power with my free online quiz at <a href=\"http://majo.co\" rel=\"noopener\">http://majo.co</a>",

            "description": "Discover your creative, feminine power with my free online quiz at <a href=\"http://majo.co\" rel=\"noopener\">http://majo.co</a><br /><br />Have you ever had the urge to follow the opposite of what you learned in school? That’s a theme for my guest Ann Shen – an illustrator and author of Bad Girls Throughout History and Legendary Ladies, books that depict women as they are: complex, funny, dark and everywhere in between. In fact, her book Bad Girls Throughout History  resonated so much that it has even been picked up by Universal Cable Productions to become a show.  <br /><br />A daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, Ann calls herself a reformed goody two shoes who creates art that empowers women to be their authentic badass selves. She combines incredible artistic talent with a high degree of business sense and shows us that choosing your own path does not have to mean depending on your parents, spouse, or whoever to survive. While her professors in art school pushed the students to all create very masculine, serious art, she went in the opposite direction – her own style that markets to women in a really fun, whimsical way, and of course in the time of Instagram, this style blew up. You can find her empowering, delightfully illustrated, books on Amazon and in stores like Target so definitely check them out after you hear her story. <br /><br />Also as a heads up, Ann and I met and recorded at the lovely all-female co-working space The Wing in Los Angeles so the audio is a little busy and echo-ey at times and I apologize in advance, but I have a feeling that you’ll be so engaged in our conversation, you will barely notice! Plus, y’all know me: progress over perfection. <br /><br />Highlighted Excerpt<br />Ann: The art school I chose to go to was very militant and demanding. <br /><br />Majo: Okay so what were people telling you was the right kind of work and what did you discover?<br /><br />Ann: So in school, it was very trendy at the time to think about editorial illustration as the career, like the ultimate career. And you do like New York editorial illustration stuff that’s like in the New York Times, The New Yorker, like just very serious, beautiful. A lot of it is conceptual or just technically very, it just looks a certain way. And most of it was a very male-dominated view. <br /><br />Majo: Okay, and what did you discover was like what you really wanted to do and move into?<br /><br />Ann: That’s my favorite question because it wasn’t something that was really presented to me as an option and then I discovered this later was I just wanted to do stuff for women.  Stuff that I was interested in, stuff that was floral or decorative or representative. Like just having something that’s like “oh, this is just a beautiful painting”. It either had to be a beautiful fine art oil painting or it had to have like a really brilliant concept behind it for it to be considered “good” in school.  And then I left and I was like “Oh, it’s good enough for it just to be a beautiful thing that brings people joy”. <br /><br />Discover your creative, feminine power with my free online quiz at <a href=\"http://majo.co\" rel=\"noopener\">http://majo.co</a>",

We have a lot of exciting interviews for you with incredibly creative, badass women including an extremely gifted illustrator Ann Shen who wrote Bad Girls Throughout History, as well as a renowned astro loger and businesswoman Debra Silverman here to ground astrology for us, and make it super practical and applicable to our lives as creative women. AND we’ll be continuing with the archetype series, looking at two archetypes that exist with yourself, including my favorite the Wtich.  Also, doing something I have never done in three years of running the show. My editor Anne is going to interview ME for an episode. A lot of you have been asking me about my story, and who I am, and what I’ve been up to, and it’s true I haven’t really shared, I’m an introvert, I’m private, I’m a mysterious Scorpio you’ll always feel is a little inaccessible, so we thought it would be a fun experiment, plus she’s journalist and knows how to ask questions. So stay tuned for that! <br /><br />The new season will kick off next Thursday on September 26th and run until mid-November and I’ll also be sprinkling some bonus episodes throughout.<br /><br />Until then!<br />Majo<br /><br />Oh wait! Heroine, before you go, I have a really important question for you: Do you want to look back on your life in 40 years from now and feel like you didn’t live up to your greatest, creative potential? I’m pretty sure the answer is no. Yet perhaps you know in your heart of hearts that you are currently holding back your voice and gifts, that you aren’t as expanded as you could be, and frankly you’re feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and confused. You’re certainly not alone. Well, I want to help, and the first step I propose is you taking a free quiz that is on my website right now, that I’m really excited about cause I haven’t offered anything like this in the past, but what it’s going to do is help you identify your unique, feminine, creative power and give you one practical action step to channel this power in a way that elevates your leadership. It’s a quiz that’s going to give you something really tangible and a ton of clarity, I know that a bunch of lightbulbs and connections will set off for you when you take it so go ahead and take the free quiz at majo.co (MAJO.CO), discover your creative, feminine power, and how to best leverage it, because the world needs more women’s voices, perspectives, and above all, creativity, so after this is announcement is done, type this into your mobile or desktop browser MAJO.

I interviewed two guests: Adereni Fashokun - a Life Coach, Co-Founder and Sr. HR Business Partner at Amazon AND Lauren Harper - the Director of Marketing at Palm. <br /><br />The topic? Technology and mental wellness. <br /><br />Does that sound like a contradiction to you, heroine? Sometimes it does to me, too.<br /><br />Technology is increasingly a part of our lives. It can feel impossible to get away from it. <br /><br />A friend of mine once had her phone break down for an entire weekend. At first she was furious, and then fearful. But she and her husband had plans that weekend, and as she immersed herself in what they were doing, she forgot about her phone. She was able to lose herself in activities. To let go. It was a kind of mental recharge she didn’t know she needed. Once her phone was fixed, she reflected that she had felt better that weekend than she had in a long time.<br /><br />So how do we set limits with technology, so we too can experience this kind of mental recharge…. and still stay connected to the world? <br /><br />The guests on today’s show offer ideas you may have never thought about. I’ll share just one: turn off all of the alerts on your phone. All of them. No beep for a text. No on screen notification that you just got an email. My editor Anne is doing this now, and she says it’s made a huge difference in her ability to focus on what’s happening in the moment. <br /><br />Stay tuned as the Fall season will pick up in September.

            "description": "Earlier in this season we talked about fairy tales. Queens, specifically…. and waifs. The waif is a passive figure, like the stereotypical vision of Rapunzel. She sits, in a tower, waiting for someone to come and rescue her. <br /><br />(Quick note: This episode is from the archive and available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine or wherever you get your podcasts.  You can also stream it live from any browser on spreaker.com/heroine).<br /><br />As the writer and cultural critic Gloria Anzaldúa once said, “Nobody’s going to save you. No one’s going to cut you down, cut the thorns thick around you. No one’s going to storm the castle walls nor kiss awake your birth, climb down your hair, nor mount you onto the white steed. There is no one who will feed the yearning. Face it. You will have to do, do it yourself.”<br /><br />Some women seem to understand this inherently, and live their lives accordingly. Some of us struggle a bit more to accept this.<br /><br />American Photojournalist and New York Times Best Selling Author Lynsey Addario falls into that first camp. She’s a war photographer who works in conflict zones all over the world. <br /><br />Throughout her entire career, Lynsey has been willing to risk her life, her safety, and her creature comforts to pursue what makes her feel alive. <br /><br />She’s photographed women under the Taliban, documented misogyny in the Congo and been kidnapped in Libya. And she has also found love and become a mother. <br /><br />Lynsey’s story reminds me to choose to do what is meaningful …. To feed the yearning, as Gloria Anzaldúa says.<br /><br />Also, heroine, today’s episode wraps up the Spring season, though keep your ear open for a bonus episode or two dropping this summer. And don’t worry, we’ll pick back up in the Fall. Also, this episode happens to be the 100th episode of the podcast. Can you believe it?

But unlike many famous leaders, and especially many famous FASHION leaders, Eileen is not driven by ego. She is humble. Midwestern. The Devil Wears Prada...she is decidedly, NOT. Throughout our interview, I wondered, how can such a strong leader speak with such a down to earth realness? <br /><br />Perhaps it’s because Eileen is an example of how to succeed well. As her brand continues to grow, she continues to reinvent. Instead of defining her business by how much money it makes, her company’s new parameter of success…. is sustainability. Her new mantra is do the most good instead of make the most money.<br /><br />In a world where our political leaders deny climate change...and other painful truths such as a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body...all to hold on to power...I think we can all take something from Eileen’s example.<br /><br />Live your values, show up, try.

            "description": "What happens when you marry someone who becomes rich and famous? Perhaps you find yourself becoming a bit blonder, a bit more stylish, and less, well, you -  to fit into his life. I think we’ve all done this to a certain extent. Changed ourselves to fit the needs of someone we wanted to fit with. <br /><br />(Quick note: This episode is from the archive and available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine or wherever you get your podcasts.  You can also stream it live from any browser on spreaker.com/heroine).<br /><br />But let’s say this all happens in the public eye. You and this man start a family. And after all this stretching and shifting, tragedy strikes. Nothing can insulate us from that. <br /><br />And then, he breaks up with you. And quickly takes up with someone new.<br /><br />That’s what happened to Justine Musk. She’s a writer, speaker and soul-blogger. She is also the ex-wife of tech billionaire and provocateur Elon Musk. <br /><br />When I interviewed Justine, I was reminded of why I do this podcast. Justine experienced something in the Heroine’s journey called the descent. In crude terms, Justine was kind of a starter wife. She herself has said this in an article she wrote for Marie Claire. But as we’ve seen with our examination of archetypes in fairy tales at the beginning of the season, this one is woefully inadequate. It’s an oversimplification as they do little to reveal the soul of the person. <br /><br />And the origins of Justine’s story don’t define her. It’s what she chose to do with her story...that does.<br /><br />And it’s the descent - the darkness in her life that revealed the light of who she is. Which I think...is the truth for all great heroines. As the Sufi mystic Rumi once said, be patient where you sit in the dark, the dawn is coming. <br /><br />References: <br />Check out Justine's blog at <a href=\"http://justinemusk.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://justinemusk.com/</a><br /><br />A BIG THANK YOU & SHOUT OUT TO OUR BADASS PATRONS ESPECIALLY: <br /><br />Brigid Cabry Nelson  leads Lettershop, an award-winning creative studio that serves a wide range of clients—from boutique retailers to large corporations—approaching each and every project with vigor and enthusiasm.

Honestly, I remember feeling so nervous, not so much during the conversation, but more so in sharing the interview, as it was the first show that launched the podcast. Today, my editor, Anne, recut this so it’s lively, fresh and even more revelatory. <br /><br />(Quick note: This episode is from the archive and available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine or wherever you get your podcasts.  You can also stream it live from any browser on spreaker.com/heroine). <br /><br />Give yourself a second to really think about the fact that Roz rows across oceans alone. She sits in a small boat, day after day, with little besides the cold waves for company and the sea mist hitting her face. This is a woman who is comfortable with solitude….and freedom.<br /><br />But when Roz started rowing, she was, in her words, “just a management consultant” from the UK.  <br /><br />So...how did she get to that wide, open ocean? What drives someone to leave everything they’ve known for so long to achieve a distant goal? In a way, that’s really the central question of this podcast. How do we stop being good girls and start being the heroines we’re meant to be? How do we write our own stories, create our own myths? How do we activate our own potential - even when it goes against all of our social conditioning?<br /><br />Roz ended up leaving her ordinary life because she sat down one day and wrote herself two obituaries. It sounds morbid, but for Roz it was clarifying. In one version, she had lived life as a business woman, in control and with fancy clothes. In the other, well, I won’t give too much away. Let’s just say, in the other obituary, her clothes didn’t matter. <br /><br />References:<br />Roz Savage’s book, \"Rowing the Atlantic: Lessons Learned on the Open Ocean.\" <br />Roz Savage’s website, <a href=\"http://www.rozsavage.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.rozsavage.com/</a><br /><br />A BIG THANK YOU & SHOUT OUT TO OUR BADASS PATRONS ESPECIALLY: <br /><br />Brigid Cabry Nelson  leads Lettershop, an award-winning creative studio that serves a wide range of clients—from boutique retailers to large corporations—approaching each and every project with vigor and enthusiasm.

            "description": "Today, we’re going to sink deeper into the waif archetype to understand the true essence of the powerful fairytale and heroine Rapunzel. <br /><br />This episode is available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine (or wherever you get your podcasts).  You can also stream it live from any browser here. <br /><br />Let’s bring back Kate Forsyth – an incredible novelist and fairy tale connoisseur – from the last episode. Kate argues the motifs we believe are passive in the tale, or that look passive at first glance, really aren’t. Here’s our convo.<br /><br />Majo: Yeah, I mean on the one hand her hair is kind of passive because it's dropping off the side of the building and it's being climbed on or it's being used but on the other hand –<br /><br />Kate: See I don't think that is a symbol of passivity, her own hair is the only form of ingress to her, it's the only way that people can reach her in her isolated state and in the end try and think of it more her hair is actually a symbol of her own strength that is being used against her. And once she's freed from that that is when she comes into her true power. It's not necessarily a symbol of passivity, in fact Rapunzel is not a passive figure, she sings with all of her strength and that draws the prince to her, she allows herself, she takes control of her life even though she is trapped against her will in this confined space. It's a misunderstanding of the fairy tale to use her as an example of female passivity.<br /><br />Majo: Yeah, that's really helpful, I love what you wrote, \"Rapunzel's no passive maiden awaiting rescue. She was an active agent in events, an empowering figure. Though later versions increasingly drain the tale of it's subversive power.\"<br /><br />Kate: I mean that is exactly right, so the earliest versions are when she's at her most active. <br /><br />So what happened? Turns out the Grimm brothers, who were telling these tales in a very religious society, received a ton of backlash for the Rapunzel story. The story of lovers having sex in a tower was too racy (especially for children), so they stripped away the eroticism, darkness, and violence out of the original story. As Kate shares, <br /><br />The Grimm's were trying to make their stories more suitable for children but Rapunzel was never meant for children, it was always meant for young women on the verge of their own sexual lives. <br /><br />Because the truth is Rapunzel was proactive, clever, and resourceful. She was not waiting around. In one older version of the tale by Italian folk collector Giambattista Basile, Rapunzel is even more fierce, as she finds three acorns from the witch she then uses against her. Each acorn becomes an animal ally of sorts – first a dog, then a lion, and finally a wolf that devours and kills the witch. I was super into this version, and was going to go with it and be like, “See Rapunzel’s a warrior!” until I met Kate, who brought way more refinement to the conversation. <br /><br />Kate was attracted to the version written by 18th Century French, female writer Charlotte Rose De La Force. Because in that version, it is Rapunzel who heals the prince with her tears. The more I reflect on both versions, I do love what De La Force did to the tale...Rapunzel’s tears are not a sign of weakness, but of power. This got me thinking about something a friend once told me, “healing doesn’t happen through force, or action, it happens through relaxation, opening…release.” Tears are a form of release, sacred tears are the release that, like the rain, allow for new growth to happen. For centuries, we’ve been shamed for having tears, for being emotional, we’re called hysterical, when our feelings are a source of our intelligence as women, and I think that’s what Rapunzel is truly all about. Feelings, sadness, grief, and tears, allow us to release and move on, allow us and others to heal. Tears are a sign of compassion. In fairy tales, we’re so used to good versus evil, but Rapunzel not only heals the Prince, but she redeems the witch. Rapunzel moves the witch to remorse for what she’s done, essentially saving the old, magical woman in the process. In other words, it isn’t about dominance and winning, but about harmony. I don’t know about you, but I can feel my entire body go into a deep sigh of relief when I hear that one.<br /><br />I’m only scratching the surface of our conversation in this post, as you’ll need to listen to the episode ( ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine and here)  to get the full picture of Kate’s work and the real depth of this tale and heroine. <br /><br />So now it’s your turn: What tears are you holding back, when, and with whom?  Who do you need to have a good cry with? And who do you need to nurture and forgive? Big questions, and I don’t have the answers for you, but that’s the power in the waif archetype, that’s what lies truly underneath her, and that is maybe even how we change the world. <br /><br />Thanks for tuning in, this has been a really amazing series for me, and I enjoyed every second of this experiment of examining fairy tales. To be honest, it has rejuvenated my love for this podcast and strengthened my conviction in the power of stories and female-drive narratives with heroines at the center, battling their inner and outer shadows. <br /><br />Alright, heroine, til next time!<br /><br />xx<br /><br />Majo<br /><br />P.S. As a reminder, next episodes, we’re going to be going back into the archive while throwing a fresh perspective on each interview, with a new setup and new cut, so you can really let their stories sink in, in relationship to the work we’ve explored with fairy tales and myths. <br /><br />A BIG THANK YOU & SHOUT OUT TO OUR BADASS PATRONS ESPECIALLY: <br /><br />Brigid Cabry Nelson  leads Lettershop, an award-winning creative studio that serves a wide range of clients—from boutique retailers to large corporations—approaching each and every project with vigor and enthusiasm.

            "description": "Today, we’re kicking off the first part of exploring the waif archetype, also know as the very passive maiden in the tower, the princess waiting to be rescued, and the good girl – an archetype I’ve long been fascinated with and am even writing a whole book about (coming out next year, still can’t believe it!). <br /><br />Today’s episode is available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine (or wherever you get your podcasts).  You can also stream it live from any browser here. <br /><br />Some of you may be wondering why I’m focusing on fairy tales, when most of us haven’t thought about them since we were children. What do they have to do with you now? To help me answer this question, I invited Australian author Kate Forsyth onto the show. Kate has retold many fairy tales through her novels, including Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Rapunzel. I asked Kate if she thinks that reading fairy tales as little girls actually affects us as adult women. Kate says that yes, fairy tales help prepare us for what’s to come:<br /><br />I mean in a way the witches and the dragons and the ogres, these are metaphors that allow us to examine things like fear of abandonment, fear of not being loved, fear of failure, fear of death, fear of harm. And because they're generally told in a safe place in a circle of light around a fire, in the comfort of a mothers lap, while tucked up in bed, because the person listening to the story is safe, it enables them to for a while in their imagination do battle with these witches and these monsters and triumph over them. Now we know, neurologically speaking, that anything that we experience in our imagination acts in the brain as if it has actually happened. So when we feel that thrill of triumph at having outwitted the witch well our brain processes it as if we had actually done it.<br /><br />So these stories help us learn emotional resilience and intelligence, and if we were fed wonky stories, or if we didn’t fully integrate them as little girls, that will affect how we live and lead down the road.  A few years ago, Kate completed her PhD on reimagining the Rapunzel archetype, which is why I specifically reached out to her. I thought she could better help me understand this maiden in the tower. <br /><br />In this episode, we go over the Rapunzel tale together, which is super important because some of you may remember it differently (I was shocked by the ending, which I had no memory of whatsoever). In her more reduced interpretation (as a trope for female passivity), Rapunzel represents this idea of feeling trapped, which is symbolized by the tower in the  tale, as Kate shares:<br /><br />I mean fairy tales work at this kind of metaphorical or archetypal level and it's a rare human that does not find themselves trapped and disempowered by their circumstances in some way. And so in Rapunzel the tower stands in for anything that is tying back the human spirit, it might be fear, it might be an unhappy relationship, it might be ones own parents, it might be the school that you are forced to go to against your will, it might be a job that is making you deeply unhappy. It's a metaphorical tower and so for that reason it is the most memorable motif in the fairy tale.<br /><br />So what’s your tower right now? It could be internal or external. That’s my question to you. Or let me put it this way: what is the story you’re telling yourself, about how you’re trapped, and you have no choice to be doing this or that. Remember, an uncomfortable situation and relationship can be bizarrely comfortable because it’s familiar, so we forget amidst that cozy comfort, that we still have choice. Every day, every second, we are making choices. The first step to getting out of your tower is taking back your agency by seeing that you have choice. Rapunzel made choices. She was far more proactive than we think. <br /><br />I’m only scratching the surface of our conversation in this post, as you’ll need to listen to the episode ( ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine and here)  to get the full picture of Kate’s work and the real depth of this tale and heroine. <br /><br />xx<br /><br />Majo<br /><br />P.S. In the next episode, we’re going to explore the possibility and power of healing and redemption in Rapunzel (seeing her beyond her usual interpretation, and what we can learn from her).

            "datePublished": "Thu, 18 Apr 2019 10:00:20 +0000",
            "description": "For the first four episodes of this season, we’re exploring the female archetypes (and stereotypes!) in old fairy and folk tales. First up – the Queen. To quickly recap – in the last episode, we learned about the sequel to Sleeping Beauty’s “happily ever after” in which she has to deal with her mother-in-law –  the evil Queen Mother – an ogre and wants to eat her twin babies. If you haven’t listened to that episode, go back and do so, otherwise this second part won’t make sense. Today, we’re going to sink deeper into this archetype to understand what’s going really going on – and in the process, learn more about ourselves.  <br /><br />Episodes are available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine (or wherever you get your podcasts).  You can also stream it live from any browser here. <br /><br />So, I came across a 17th Century version of Sleeping Beauty called Sun, Moon, and Talia, and oh heroine, did this really put the Queen in perspective for me. It helped me see her in a completely different light. <br /><br />In this other version, the evil Queen isn’t the King’s mother, but get this, she’s the King’s wife. Yes, Sleeping Beauty– or Talia – is actually the “third” woman in this tale. That’s right, our homeboy King is a player. He already had a wife before he met Sleeping Beauty – it’s the part Disney doesn’t mention. He’s just doing what Kings did back then, sleep with whoever they wanted.<br /><br />So we begin to see that there’s a complicated relationship between the King and the Queen. At one point in the tale, when The Queen thinks he’s eating one of his own kids (the kids he would have had with another woman), she tells him, and I quote “\"Eat away! for you eat what is your own.\" What the King replies is fascinating, and I quote “\"Ay, I know well enough that what I eat is my own, for you brought nothing to the house.\" Oh snap. That’s a rude response. The tale writes, “And at last getting up in a rage, he went off to a villa at a little distance to cool his anger.”<br /><br />In other words, the King is annoyed that the Queen isn’t contributing “bread” to the table. This line could be interpreted many ways. Either he’s mad she hasn’t brought home the bacon or he could be shaming her for coming with a small dowry. But what options does a Queen have, locked in a Kingdom, in a patriarchal society, to go out and bring something to the house? Very little. In fact, in most of these fairy tales, the King is always quite mobile of course, traversing stretches of land, while the Princesses and Queens are confined within walls, or being ordered around to go from place A to B. It’s clear that the Queen is powerless in the patriarchy with her lead patriarch, very literally the King. At one point, when she confronts Talia who we know as Sleeping Beauty – the woman her husband is having an affair with –  she says, “Are you the weed that has caught my husband’s eye and given me all this trouble? So so, you are come at last to purgatory, where I'll make you pay for all the ill you have done me.\" Obviously, Talia’s not the problem – the King is the main issue here, lest this becomes an episode of Jerry Springer. Both Talia and the Queen are powerless in different ways.<br /><br />So, it’s obvious and quite justified – one of the ways the Queen has responded to betrayal, hurt, and feelings of powerlessness is to become a total Queen. Duh. In other words, she claims control because she’s been badly hurt. She’s wounded! When we see the full context of the Queen, we can see how she’s very connected to the inner victim...underneath Queen behavior is a feeling (and perhaps even a reality) of victimhood. <br /><br />Ok, now it’s our time to turn it to you. How have you felt out of control in your life, and how has that made you double down on becoming more controlling? For some of us, we grow up in chaotic households, so we turn to controlling what we eat. In my case, I grew up moving around a lot, not having control in where I’d live or what community so I doubled down by becoming an hyper-achiever. Perhaps we’ve been emotionally, sexually, or physically betrayed or hurt by others, and as a way to defend ourselves, we turn up our inner Queens, and it works. The Queen is fierce.<br /><br />She also has her merit. Yah! Let’s talk about her merit. One of the major strengths I see in women who have and own this archetype fully is that they know what they want, aren’t afraid to ask for it, and aren’t afraid to go for it. That’s the blessing of the Queen. Sure, in the fairy tale, that desire is directed towards evil, or fear, instead of good, or love – but this character is not a passive, floating character, waiting to be rescued. She’s a bad bitch. <br /><br />Remember my friend Dionna, from last episode? She shared how being a Queen does help her own her womanhood and power. Here she is again, talking about what she actually likes about being a Queen:<br /><br />Dionna: I went to West Point and so to be one of the few women in an environment, it'd be easy to shrink in that environment and take on really masculine energy. And so I think being able to stay in your womanhood but stand still as a leader among leaders, I think that's definitely a showcase of that part of me for sure.<br /><br />I think in the end, the key is to direct this energy of desire – this flavor of Queen – towards authentic goals, and not ones that come from our wounds and feelings of powerlessness (many of which are subconscious). Now that’s a life long journey, if you ask me. <br /><br />Don’t forget to tune into the episode on ApplePodcasts.com/HEROINE (or wherever you get your podcasts) to dive deeper, and let this one really sink in. The Queen is far more complex than she looks like on the outside. By understanding stories, we can begin to understand ourselves a little bit more. <br /><br />Majo<br /><br />P.S.  Next episode, we’re going to explore her opposite – the Waif – the Passive Princess, the Good Girl...and archetype I’ve long been fascinated with and am even writing a whole book about, yes a book that’s coming out next year (May 2020, HarperOne).<br /><br />A BIG THANK YOU & SHOUT OUT TO OUR BADASS PATRONS ESPECIALLY: <br /><br />Brigid Cabry Nelson  leads Lettershop, an award-winning creative studio that serves a wide range of clients—from boutique retailers to large corporations—approaching each and every project with vigor and enthusiasm.

            "description": "For the next four episodes on Heroine, we’re exploring the female archetypes (and stereotypes!) in old fairy and folk tales. The first archetype we’re going to explore is one of my favorites – the Queen.<br /><br />Obviously the “evil” Queen is a common storytelling trope. But like all tropes, they’re simultaneously false and real. They’re real in that by learning and growing up around these characters, we internalize some of them. They’re false in that they’re still tropes, which means nobody is all Queen, or all Princess, all of the time – that’s a sweet oversimplification. <br /><br />We’re going to first explore how there’s some reality in this Queen archetype. If we think of these characters as part of our own psyche, who is the reckless Queen out to control and maintain power? Is this a part of you that’s loud in your life, or quiet? <br /><br />I was curious about the Queen archetype in the women in my life – so I thought I’d interview a mutual friend.<br /><br />Meet Dionna.<br /><br />Dionna: My name is Dionna McPhatter. I'm the co-founder of Nacci (naccidigital.com). We do data driven storytelling that harnesses the power of data, data science, narrative and storytelling and design thinking to bring solutions to businesses.<br /><br />Majo: Do you feel like others perceive you to be like queenly or have this energy?<br /><br />Dionna: Yeah, I think so. I think there's plenty more to me, but yeah, I think that this wouldn't be hard for them to ... I mean, I have people that call me Queen D. So I think that has come out early and I never asked for that as a title.<br /><br />Majo: Do you have example from your own life where you were like, oh dang, maybe I was too much, maybe I was too powerful in this situation or too assertive or too queenly and I should've peeled back or that got me in trouble.<br /><br />Dionna: Trouble, no. I see it all as learning. I haven't felt in trouble in a long time, but I think the ... I've had times where I'm leading a team or I'm just on the team.  So it was all of my peers and so, I didn't see myself as higher than them. But I just have a certain way that I communicate. And I got feedback that because I communicate with such clarity, that made people feel like I wasn't open to their ideas, right? There's plenty of times when I choose not to speak, so you know I don't really care that much or I'm in listening mode or whatever. But when I choose to speak about something, I am passionate, so that can deter other people sometimes. And then, when they're speaking, they can think that I'm not listening.<br /><br />I can really relate to Dionna, because I have a lot of the Queen archetype within me. And it manifests in a variety of ways – I want things done, when I want them, efficiently, and on my own time. I like to delegate, I actually have no problem with it at all. And being a Queen feels great most of the time, but I did notice that there’s a downside to it – people often don’t feel my warmth, or feel cared for, when I’m acting like a Queen. One time I was queening out, and dissatisfied by someone I hired to help handle my social media. I found myself getting irritated, and angry, and snappy at her. You know since my Queen is a total perfectionist, one who wants it perfect or not at all.  And then she quit! I felt relieved, but also kind of embarrassed. I realized when I’m being a Queen, people obviously don’t want to collaborate. The impact of that of course, is that Queens end up lonely and isolated in their glass or ice palaces. They shut themselves off from the world. <br /><br />It’s hard for me to admit tell you about the times I Queen because she’s not a part of myself I’m proud of. Even now, I can feel how uncomfortable it is to share with you, because it’s an ugly dark part of myself (the shadow!) I sometimes wish would go away, especially when she’s acting out. <br /><br />So how about you? What is your relationship to this trait? Does it help you get things done? Do you value it? Do you feel trapped by it? Do you secretly resent it? Perhaps you feel don’t have enough of this archetype expressing in you – your inner Queen is muffled and quiet, she’s buried under the fear of being seen as bossy or too dominant. That’s real too. Many of us stay away from her, because of what we’ve learned in fairy tales, that we’ll be punished if we’re total Queens. <br /><br />The Queen is far more complex than she looks like on the outside. In the next episode, we’re going to go deeper with the Queen (and her true power) by looking at one of the older versions of the tale. She’s power-tripping for a reason, you know. Queens don’t become controlling out of thin air. <br /><br />By understanding stories, we can understand ourselves.

            "description": "One of the reasons I started this podcast was to share women’s stories – showing us as complex, nuanced, and still very much in progress. But as we know, stories like this have only become available to us recently. I remember as a little girl, being bombarded by Disney Princesses, witches, and evil step mothers who were one dimensional and pretty flat. <br /><br />But a lot of these characters were based on older stories which were far darker, even more multi-layered and satisfying. Old folk tales that show us the full dimensionality of who we are as women. That’s why this season, we’re going to explore these older tales and uncover more about ourselves in the process. Have you ever felt like a major Queen, stirring up drama for yourself and those around you? Or have you ever felt like a waif, a kind of frail woman, who is too breakable to take on a challenge? <br /><br />For the first half of this new season, we’ll explore how there are more to these female archetypes (and stereotypes!) than what we see on the surface. We’ll talk about how by embodying and rejecting them, they play out in our personal and professional lives. <br />Ok, so that will be the first part of the season. For the second part, my editor Anne Hoffman and I have curated and freshened up four interviews from the archive that relate to the theme of archetypes. You’re going to hear from record-breaking rower Roz Savage (she was my first interview ever), Justine Musk, a writer and the ex-wife of Elon Musk, design icon Eileen Fisher, and from New York Times Award-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario. Even if you’ve listened to these episodes, I guarantee you will hear something new in them the second or third time.<br /><br />Also, I invite you to connect with me on my website that has a ton of free resources for you such as a Rituals e-Guide, Creative Confidence Playbook, articles, and also a free guided meditation. Check it out on majo.co (MAJO.CO). <br /><br />An episode will be released every Thursday as usual – and the season will run for eight weeks starting on April 11th. Onward!",

            "description": "For more tips and inspiration, go to my website majo.co and follow me on Instagram @majo.heroine<br /><br />You made it this is the last and final minisode in a four part series on boundaries. If you haven’t already done so, make sure to listen to the entire series from top to bottom, because it will give you a full picture on how you can maintain healthy, strong, boundaries to be more badass in a world that is clawing at your time and attention.<br /><br />In this episode, I want to introduce you to a four-step communication tool for speaking up when something is bothering you, when you feel someone has overstepped one of your boundaries, and you want to let them know that’s not cool with you. <br /><br />Because in working with and talking to hundreds of women, I noticed a pattern – after years of growing up in the patriarchy, when something bothers us, we don’t speak up. <br /><br />You know, It starts in our teens. Harvard researchers found that during adolescence, girls stop speaking from their experience, and expressing their true feelings and thoughts, even though they were outspoken as children. They literally lose their voices, become more quiet, and say “I don’t know” a million times, really as a way to hide. The researchers conclude “to say what they are feeling and thinking often means to risk losing their relationships...”<br /><br />Sound familiar? It starts in our teens but carries on into our 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond. <br /><br />The tool I want to introduce to you is called nonviolent communication – NVC for short. Started by a psychologist in the 60s, Marshall Rosenberg, this process will help to communicate to others about you need with less judgment.<br /><br />You might want to pause the audio and grab a paper if it’s helpful to take notes.<br /><br />Surely, you’ve been in a scenario, where you’ve felt triggered and want to respond, so what can you do? <br /><br />NVC consists of four simple steps:<br />Step 1: State the facts – What events did you observe? <br />Step 2. State your feelings – How did you feel?<br />Step 3. State your needs – What is your unmet need? (Note: I like to give the option of stating your values here, if that works better in a professional context than your needs)<br />Step 4. State your requests – What is your request? What do you want moving forward?<br /><br />I’m going to break it down and run through examples and tips.<br /><br />Step 1. What events did you observe?<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Example: “Last month, you authored the article about our project.”<br /><br />Notice here, that I’m sticking to the facts. It’s something that a third party objective observer would agree , and couldn’t be argued. <br />Tips:<br />So, you want to stick to the facts. “You seldom do what I want,” is an evaluation, versus “You did not attend the last three meetings,” which is more factual.<br />You want to be specific. “She frequently attends,” is too vague, versus “She attended at least three times a week,” which is precise.<br />You want to focus on observable behaviors. Memories about words people said can be subjective and distorted, so report on actions. <br /><br />Step 2. How did you feel? “I felt …<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Example: “I felt frustrated.”<br />Tips:<br />Focus on emotions and sensations. Most derive from these five: sadness, disgust, fear, joy, and anger. <br />Avoid thoughts (e.g., \"I feel like I didn't get a fair deal\"), stories about yourself  (e.g., \"insecure\"), how you think others are evaluating you (e.g., \"unimportant\"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., \"misunderstood,\" \"ignored\").<br />Be vulnerable. It takes courage to state something plainly, but it’s powerful!<br /><br /><br />Step 3. What is your unmet need or value? “Because I need/value ….<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Example: “Because I need/value collaboration and equality.”<br />Tips:<br />Focus on universal human needs and/or cultural values. Under your feeling is an unmet need or unheld value.<br />That’s why you’re hurt, sad, surprised, frustrated, because some universal human need feels like it isn’t being met. <br />For a list of common needs, check out: <a href=\"http://www.cnvc.org/Training/needs-inventory\" rel=\"noopener\">www.cnvc.org/Training/needs-inventory</a><br /><br />Step 4. What is your request?<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Example: “When we launch the next product, I’d love to author the announcement post. How does that sound?”<br />Tips:<br />Use clear, actionable language. <br />Don’t expect a yes. Requests are free of demand. We put the request out there, but it may not necessarily be met. <br />Empathize. If you receive a \"no,” don’t give up. Instead, empathize with what is preventing the other person from saying \"yes\" before deciding how to continue the conversation.<br /><br /><br />So there you have it, the four steps to non-violent communication. Honestly, it’s one of the most powerful communication tools I’ve come across – and I’ve used it on myself and with clients, with family, with friends, and it’s really given me the power to set a boundary about what I need and want, and share how I feel about a situation, instead of staying quiet, and stewing in my bitterness. <br /><br />Outro:<br />That’s it.<br />We have wrapped up our minisode series on boundaries – I hope you found it helpful. Since starting the series, you have gained so many more tools in your toolbelt to conserve, and yes, protect your energy, so that you can invest it towards your creativity and calling on this planet. We really need you to have those boundaries as a modern woman, so that you rock your heroine’s journey to its fullest. <br /><br />If you care about living an empowered life, go follow me on Instagram @majo.heroine more juiciness – and go to my website majo.co and get on my email list for more updates about my work and this podcast. You got options. Lots of love, heroine.",

            "datePublished": "Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:00:09 +0000",
            "description": "I’m thrilled about today’s interview. Shiza Shahid co-founded The Malala Fund along with the youngest Nobel-Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. I’m sure you already know this, but just in case, Malala was the young girl in Pakistan who was shot in the head on her school bus by the Taliban for going to school, but she survived and became internationally recognized. So Shiza, who I speak to in this interview, was one of Malala’s early mentors. While in college, Shiza started a secret summer camp for girls in Pakistan, which is also her home country. Today,  Shiza is a venture capital investor and many other things. Named one of Time's \"30 Under 30 People Changing the World\" and Forbes \"30 Under 30 - Social Entrepreneurs,\" she’s also host of the USA Today news show \"ASPIREist,\" which activates millennials to have a positive impact.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://majomolfino.com/blog/2018/11/1/shiza-shahid\" rel=\"noopener\">http://majomolfino.com/blog/2018/11/1/shiza-shahid</a><br /><br />In this episode, we talk about why empowering women around the world is so important and what Shiza sees as global trends as she travels to different continents. As a fellow immigrant, she shares how culture helped her shift perspectives, and what it means to reclaim your identity when you grow up cross-culturally. <br /><br />Highlighted Excerpt: <br /><br />Majo: You do so much. How do you stay grounded? How do you avoid overwhelm or do you just feel overwhelmed?<br /><br />Shiza: How do I avoid overwhelm? I think perhaps by  not comparing myself. I think a lot of the overwhelm comes from comparison. Now when we do good things we have to put it on Instagram and count how many likes it got, and I think a lot of that comparison causes dissatisfaction and unhappiness. Because if you go and truly help someone, the way that will make you feel will give you so much satisfaction, it will calm the fatigue and help with the overwhelm, so as long as you don’t go to that place of you know, “Is this good enough?Am I good enough?” and allow the satisfaction of doing your work become overshadowed by the comparison, which I think we’re constantly in the middle of particularly here in the West. I was in Pakistan for a while, and I realized that I didn’t buy anything for weeks, and I was barely on social media, and I came back to the U.S. and started getting hit by all these ads and all these things I felt I needed to buy, and information about other people doing other things.<br /><br />Majo: When you came back you started noticing that you were comparing? <br /><br />Shiza: Absolutely. I think that over here, there’s a lot of that comparison, even when you’re doing so called social impact work, you’re still comparing –<br /><br />Majo: Right. Like, who’s doing more social impact work.<br /><br />Shiza: Right. I think avoiding that. Getting outside this place which can really do that to you, and focusing on direct impact. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br /><br />Shiza’s parents and upbringing in Pakistan [3:20]<br /><br />On volunteering as a teenager in women’s prisons and her passionate activism as a young woman [5:36]<br /><br />Applying to college in the U.S. on a whim and her decision to go to Stanford where she was first exposed to technology and entrepreneurship, but still feeling connected to help women and girls back in Pakistan [6:58]<br /><br />The online diary of Malala Yousafzai (at the time, 11 years old), inspiring Shiza’s creation of a secret summer camp amongst dangerous circumstances [11:30]<br /><br />Joining McKinsey and receiving the news of Malala being shot [14:00]<br /><br />On co-founding and building The Malala Fund at age 22 and leaving the safe, predictable path [21:00]<br /><br />Witnessing Malala become the first child to win The Nobel Peace Prize and how it shifted stereotypes about what courage looks like [26:00]<br /><br />On the polarization of technology, tech utopianism, and how social media creates a divide and leads to a rise in extremism, as well as the need for a representative group of people making decisions [28:00]<br /><br />On being a global citizen and how that perspective-shifting encourages entrepreneurship [32:20]<br /><br />The patterns she sees across the world, particularly around the false facts and news, as well as untapped opportunities such as supporting women in computer science in the Middle East [36:00]<br /><br />How to deal with feelings of overwhelm and unhappiness in a culture of consumerism and comparison [40:00]<br /><br />On reclaiming identity having grown up cross-culturally [43:00]<br /><br />REFERENCES:<br /><br />Learn more about Robin Berzin and Parsley Health here. <br /><br />A BIG THANK YOU & SHOUT OUT TO OUR BADASS PATRONS ESPECIALLY: <br /><br />Brigid Cabry Nelson  leads Lettershop, an award-winning creative studio that serves a wide range of clients—from boutique retailers to large corporations—approaching each and every project with vigor and enthusiasm.

            "description": "For more tips and inspiration, go to my website majo.co and follow me on Instagram @majo.heroine<br /><br />This is the third minisode in a four part series on boundaries. Make sure to listen to the entire series, so that you can have those healthy boundaries that allow you to thrive as a modern woman, when there are so many demands on your time and energy. <br /><br />In this episode, I’m going to give you a process for clearing crap off your plate. <br /><br />We all have very full plates, don’t we? We pile it on there, because we’re ambitious, smart, modern women. In hundreds of women, I’ve seen us dry ourselves up and burn ourselves out and feel so overwhelmed and anxious because our plates are simply too full. It’s an epidemic that needs to stop. <br /><br />Here’s what you can do. <br /><br />Write a list of your commitments or things you said “yes” to but that you aren’t excited about or really meant to say no to. These also might be thought of the logistics and operations of life, that take away and claw at your energy from doing deeper, more meaningful work. These are things that may feel more like “shoulds” or obligations. <br /><br />Go ahead and pause this minisode if you need to, and grab a piece of paper, and then come back.<br /><br />Here’s an example list you might write:<br />Host dinner for the family next Saturday<br />Go to Cape Cod in July<br />Write out the brief for Jackson<br />Grocery shopping<br /><br />Create four columns, and write the following empowering VERBS at the top: ELIMINATE, DELEGATE, AUTOMATE, ASK FOR HELP. <br /><br />Your next step is to slot your different tasks into each column. The idea is to get all those annoying “should” activities of your plate and into one of these buckets. It’s amazing what eliminating can do – oftentimes, we think we have to do something, but do we really have to? Time and time again, I’ve seen that the real issue is that we’re afraid to say no and back out...make sure to circle back to the first minisode about how to no. <br /><br />Let’s define these for a second. Eliminate is obvious – take it off your list, and it ceases to exist. Delegate is when you request that somebody else do the task, instead of you. That’s pretty clear. Asking for help is different from delegating in that you’re still doing the task, but you’re doing it with someone, or having someone take a part of it off your plate. But what about automate? Automate is when you build a system that makes the behavior easier to do on a repeating basis. So, let’s take grocery shopping, a way to automate that, and cut down on your time doing it, is to use a tool like Instacart, in which you have a set repertoire of groceries that you get weekly, or signing up for one of those farm-fresh CSAs that deliver to your door. The point is, you’re not spending loads of time thinking about and doing it every week.

She’s the doctor, founder, and CEO of a wellness and medical practic, Parsley Health, that takes a whole mind-body approach to your health. Robin is on a mission to heal and reinvent American healthcare when less than 4% of CEOs in the healthcare space are female. She’s a real badass with a medical degree from Columbia University who has raised millions of dollars in venture capital. In this episode, we talk about how she dealt with being lost and confused after college, having a baby while fundraising for her startup, and how to build your creative confidence as a woman. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://majomolfino.com/blog/2018/10/18/robin-berzin\" rel=\"noopener\">http://majomolfino.com/blog/2018/10/18/robin-berzin</a><br /><br />Highlighted Excerpt:<br />Majo: How did your yoga practice help you align into your purpose?<br /><br />Robin: It taught me to listen. It taught me to listen to myself. I think I was someone who was a little bit trapped in her head and I think a lot of us live with a bit of a concrete wall between our bodies and our heads and we don’t really pay attention to what’s happening in our bodies, and we live in our minds and we live in the past; we live in the future and we’re never present. And if you’re somebody who is like a grades getter, go-getter, and an overachiever in any way, whether that’s in sports or academics, you’re rewarded constantly for that, right?<br /><br />It’s reinforced in our educational system and it’s certainly been in mine growing up in Baltimore and going into this all-girls school that was very academically oriented and also athletically oriented. I wasn’t good at the athletics part but I was pretty good at the academics part.<br /><br />For me, yoga was this moment of literally just waking up to right now and I realized I had this huge concrete wall between my head and my body. And then in many ways, there’s kind of low-grade abusing myself living on really crappy food, not really exercising, partying at night, hating my job, being in a crappy relationship with a crappy boyfriend at the time, and I think yoga was just this kind of stillness. And then I started listening; and then I started looking back to undergrad and back in my life and starting asking the questions, “What do I want to do? What do I care about? What is interesting to me and how do I want to spend my time?”<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />- On childhood, her early days as a “neat freak” and “good girl.” [01:55]<br />- Working as a paralegal and stumbling on a yoga studio that would change her life. [04:42]<br />- Losing her grandmother to colon cancer and her growing interest in medicine; winning the award for a paper in complimentary medicine. [09:17]<br />- Her amazing experience working with Dr. Oz and Oprah’s team. [20:20]<br />- Reaching out to Dr. Oz to get the job.

Make sure to listen to the entire series, so that you can have those healthy boundaries that allow you to thrive as a modern woman, when there are so many demands on your time and energy. <br /><br />Have you ever been talking to someone and then you felt completely drained? Maybe that person was in a terrible mood, or complaining, or qualifies for a personality disorder. Whatever, the case, you feel fried. <br /><br />In this minisode on boundaries, I’m going to give you a simple technique for staying grounded when you’re face-to-face with someone who feels like they might be sucking the energy off of you. <br /><br />Obviously, the most ideal scenario is for you to steer clear from energy vampires, or to cut the conversation short, and leave. <br /><br />But let’s say you’re locked in, and you’re like fuck, what do I do?<br /><br />The technique is this: drop your attention down to your feet, specifically the soles of your feet. Feel them make contact with the ground. Go ahead and do that now as you listen to this, bring your attention to your feet. And then take deep lower belly breaths. So, attention on the feet, and deep breaths while the person is speaking.<br /><br />The benefits of this simple move are amazing. You will walk away feeling less floored, and swayed by the other person’s emotions. If you’re an empath like me, you’ll feel less emotional contagion between you and the person. Don’t believe me?

            "description": "I am so honored to bring to you this conversation with a personal heroine of mine: Esther Perel. Esther is truly a thought leader in the space, with a perspective on modern relationships that is refreshingly original, insightful, and pretty un-American.  Recently, she’s been stretching the bounds of her work beyond the bedroom, which is the focus of this episode. <br /><br />More about this episode: majomolfino.com/blog/2018/10/4/esther-perel <br /><br />Can we apply something like couple's therapy to co-workers and how easily does it translate? In this episode, Esther shares how to bring the relational intelligence from our romantic lives (things like trust, empathy, vulnerability, etc) into our most difficult, stressful work relationships and creative collaborations, especially in the context of patriarchy and the #MeToo movement.<br /><br />Esther’s work practically saved my relationship with my husband before we got married– and her work really helped us see what sustains desire between two people over the long-term.  Her celebrated TED talks have garnered more than 20 million views and her international bestselling book Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence became a global phenomenon translated into 25 languages. Her newest book is the New York Times bestseller The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity. Esther is also an executive producer and host of the popular podcast  called Where Should We Begin?<br /><br />I know you will find this conversation fascinating and applicable to your life. <br /><br />Show Notes<br />Esther shares about her childhood as a bold and extroverted girl, her experience as an immigrant and the daughter of Holocaust survivors, and getting by on the goodwill of people willing to help her. [2:48]<br />Esther turns the table on Majo and asks why she felt pressured to focus on her career over relationships for so long. Plus, how Esther became a “disciple of people” and learned to navigate uncertainty while writing her first book. [7:43]<br />Why Esther enjoys taking on difficult and taboo subjects, and her non-prescriptive approach to finding solutions. [11:35]<br />The major problem with our current culture of experts. [15:43]<br />Bringing her expertise to the context of work: Esther shares her insights as a cross-cultural therapist, and the big shift she’s seeing toward reliance on relational intelligence as the core of company success. [19:59]<br />Why do 65% of startups fail? Co-founder breakups. Esther discusses the deep, intimate, and often turbulent relationship between company founders. [26:10]<br />Majo shares two true scenarios with Esther for advice on how to navigate relationships. Scenario 1: A woman being constantly triggered by her male manager who refuses to listen to her advice. [30:51]<br />Scenario 2: A woman feeling disempowered by a male CEO who favors his own ideas over hers. [38:24]<br />On difficult conversations, what’s missing from the #MeToo movement, and how we reshape and redefine relational thinking through communication (not policies or rules). [43:23]<br />“Patriarchy doesn’t just hurt women.” On polarized systems, masculine vs feminine, and the honesty required on both sides. [46:30]<br />From the bedroom to the boardroom – more resources on translating the personal to the professional.

            "description": "For more tips and inspiration, go to my website majo.co and follow me on Instagram @majo.heroine<br /><br />This is the first minisode in a four part series on boundaries. Make sure to listen to the entire series, so that you can have those healthy boundaries that allow you to thrive as a modern woman, when there are so many demands on your time and energy. By the end of the series, you’re honestly going to feel like you have so many more tools in your toolbelt to conserve your energy, so that you can channel it towards your creativity and calling on this planet. Because we ain’t got time, to be diddle daddling, OK? We need you to have those boundaries, so that you can function and be a badass. <br /><br />In this minisode on boundaries, I’m going to give you a simple template for saying no. SO SIMPLE you’re going to be like OMG, why did this take so long? <br /><br />LMK ask you this one question – How do you feel when you say yes to something, but you really mean no? Take a few seconds to think about it. What feelings come up when you agree to something you don’t really want to do, or care to do?<br /><br />When I ask most women this, they admit they feel resentful, bitter, annoyed, at the other person and themselves. <br /><br />It’s a radical concept but when you say YES when you mean NO so that you can please someone or not make them upset or because it’s easier, YOU LOSE TRUST IN YOURSELF. You essentially abandon yourself. That’s a big problem.<br /><br />The solution to this is to communicate what you want, to communicate your focus, and communicate your priority. <br /><br />Let’s take a really sticky situation. One of my clients wanted to quit her job forever, but was stalling because she didn’t want to set this boundary – to say no more to this soul-crushing job that was sucking the life out of her. She was scared of her boss’ disappointment, of her parent’s backlash etc. You know the drill. When we drilled down, it became obvious that she was nervous about not finding the right words, or screwing up in the moment, so we wrote out a script that she could practice and role play with her friends and roommates. That made it way easier. Based on the “sandwich” technique, she started and ended on a positive note, and shared her desire for the future as the filling of the sandwich. It looked like this:<br /><br />Positive: I’m grateful that I spent the last two years at this company as I learned so much.<br />Desire: It’s time that I focus on transitioning into design that focuses on social impact and international development.<br />Positive: Again, I want to reiterate that I’ve grown enormously through your guidance and appreciated all the autonomy you’ve given me throughout the years. <br /><br />Notice how she didn’t say NO to the job, but say YES to her focus...to the direction she wanted to move in. <br /><br />You can do this for anything – if someone asks you for your time, energy, or money, instead of saying NO, telling them what you’re saying YES to.

            "description": "Do you want to create more freely? If so, you might wanna shift your relationship to mistakes, and let go of some of that idealism. That’s the central topic of today’s show with actress Keiko Agena.

            "description": "Last year, Veronica Belmont hosted HBO’s Red Carpet Premiere for Game of Thrones. But after spending ten years as an online media personality, she decided to leave the world of video behind her and become a product manager. <br /><br />On today’s show, she shares about the ups and downs of being a freelancer, switching careers after ten years and embracing a new and unknown path, and how she’s becoming an expert in her new field. If you’re thinking about transitioning your role or industry and jumping over into something kind of but not really related, this is the episode for you.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Veronica growing up: A rough and tumble kind of girl who loved gadgets and tinkering with toys. [2:01]<br />-Her fascination with computers and games, joining the punk rock scene in high school, and studying Audio Production at Emerson. [5:54]<br />-Veronica’s first taste of feeling blocked because she was a woman, and how she ended up moving to San Francisco. [11:10]<br />-The hustle phase: Using Craigslist for everything (even her mattress), facing lots of rejections, and landing an internship at CNET. [15:53]<br />-Diving into her audio career, shifting from behind-the-scenes work to sharing her voice and co-hosting, and the leap to video. [23:45] <br />-Going from a super high to a super low: Veronica’s huge opportunity to host the HBO premiere of GOT, and her mistake of reading all the nasty comments about it afterward. [31:36]<br />-“It’s okay to know yourself well enough to know when you need a change.” Veronica shares about her decision to end all her contracts and stop video work. [34:39]<br />-On freelancing, the podcasts she continues to work on and how they’ve evolved, and her transition into Product Management. [38:53]<br />-The importance of becoming an expert in your domain, joining Bot Makers, and Veronica’s advice to people wanting to break into a new field. [42:32]<br />-The tendency women have to disqualify themselves from new opportunities (while men seem to do the opposite), and Veronica’s words of encouragement. [47:55]<br />-What Veronica has reclaimed for herself on her heroine’s journey.

After getting fired from all her part-time jobs at once, she hit rock bottom, but was able to find the inspiration to move forward after reading a self-help book. <br /><br />Soon after, she became friends with Lena Dunham, started writing for BuzzFeed, and is now a senior writer at Refinery29 while also working on a personal memoir. As a survivor of sexual assault, Ashley talks about letting go of shame and the relationship between personal hardships and creativity.

She recently authored the book Feminist Fight Club, an office survival guide for a sexist workplace that’s packed with hilarity and insights on the subtle and sneaky sexism that still exists in modern workplaces today. <br /><br />Jessica talks about how women have been programmed to feel competitive with each other, whether it’s okay to cry at work, and shares practical tools and techniques for dealing with sexism at work. She also shares how she overcame imposter syndrome to write for big names like the Times, and how you can overcome self doubts too.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />- A “geeky” girl with unyielding ambition and lots of lofty goals. [0:00]<br />- How she began to notice that the men around her were getting promoted faster and published more often, and how that led to uncovering an amazing story about women in the 70s who had felt the same frustration… [1:56]<br />- Growing up in liberal Seattle, Jessica admits that she wasn’t always interested in gender issues, and shares how she came to form the first feminist fight club. [6:03]<br />- Majo and Jessica talk about the subtle and insidious nature of sexism even in modern and progressive workplaces. [10:30]<br />- Diving into the book, Feminist Fight Club: How we self-sabotage, dealing with imposter syndrome, and more.

As a daughter to scientist immigrants, her parents encouraged her to pursue something practical. But after ten years of taking that route, Shyama felt the time was right to let her artsy side shine.<br /><br />Shyama shares when she has felt the most and least creative freedom on her journey to becoming a sustainable artist – from her work in graphic and interactive design, to her paintings of families living inside of dinosaurs and a giant Sasquatch made of cats. This episode will get you wondering what phase of creative freedom you're in, and whether it’s time for a change.  <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Shyama as a little girl: an introverted, only child who liked trying new and “weird” things. [2:56]<br />-On her immigrant parents, college years, and how the nature of her first job affected her creative freedom. [7:12]<br />-How rejection and getting laid off turned out to be a blessing in disguise. [13:18]<br />-From full-time work, to freelance work, to a sabbatical focused on making her own art. [17:28]<br />-How a chance opportunity to participate in an art exhibit helped quiet her inner critic and revealed the positive power of deadlines. [21:58] <br />-Deciding to move to SF for new challenges and opportunities, and the regret she felt initially. [27:09]<br />-Shyama’s insights on sustaining herself as well as having mentors and patrons.

[4:52]<br />-Discussing the research on girls during the pivotal pre-teen years, and what that time was like for Caroline.

[13:32]<br />-Caroline shares about the early difficulties of working in such a male-dominated field, and the different cultural rituals between men and women. [19:35]<br />-Being the first to volunteer for things, striving to out-brave the men and the backlash that came with that, and the different flavors of bravery. [26:25]<br />-On why parents protect girls more than boys, and the revelation Caroline’s mother had that led her to encourage her daughters to be more adventurous.

Linda Liukas is a beautiful example of this cycle. A computer programmer and children’s book author, she hopes to create a more diverse and colorful perspective of technology – starting with the poetry of coding. <br /><br />Linda’s coding book for children quickly became one of Kickstarter’s most highly funded children’s books, and her recent TEDx talk has garnered over 1.5 million views. Her unapologetic, girlish enthusiasm is contagious – she’ll get you thinking back to what you were like as a little girl and perhaps remind you of parts of yourself you’d like to reclaim. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Linda as a very imaginative little girl who loved role-playing with friends and tinkering on her dad’s computer. [3:51]<br />-How she came to develop a brave and curious attitude towards technology, plus the hilarious story of teaching herself to build a fan website for her girlhood crush, Al Gore.

[13:20]<br />-Linda’s decade away from computers and technology, what she did instead and why, and how she found her calling. [18:20]<br />-The small steps that led to her true career, early opportunities, and the start of her children’s book. [21:48]<br />-On getting swept up by projects, never graduating, and moving to New York to work with a new start-up.

[34:45]<br />-Launching her kickstarter: How she dealt with imposter syndrome as she started to see huge success.

Today’s episode features Tiffany Dufu, Chief Leadership Officer at Levo League and author of the new book Drop the Ball – a must-read for all of us trying to do everything ourselves and struggling to embrace imperfection. <br /><br />Tiffany’s gems of wisdom include the value of delegating with joy, a concept she calls “strategic chaos”, and the three attributes to look for in a partner before you build a life with them. She also talks about motherhood as the last frontier of dropping the ball.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Tiffany growing up: An imaginative “good girl” who experienced early on a sense of injustice that sparked a feminist spirit. [5:25]<br />-Trying to be valued and liked in her teenage years, plus the benefit of experiencing failure at a young age.

            "description": "This interview had our host in tears. In today’s episode, Majo speaks with Paralympic Gold Medalist Alana Nichols. Playing sports was like a safe haven for Alana, whose family life wasn’t always ideal. But at 17, she broke her back in a snowboarding accident that left her unable to walk again. As a lifelong athlete, this was devastating.<br /><br />Alana grappled with denial, depression, and isolation in college, until a magical moment turned everything around. Her story is about the power of practice, discipline, grit, and faith. And she shares powerful insights on gratitude – seeing what we have instead of what we don’t have. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Growing up as a confident, active tomboy who found her identity in sports at a young age. [4:13]<br />-On always being a risk-taker and her dreams of playing Olympic Softball. [8:46]<br />-Coming into her identity as a young teen, dealing with social pressures, and missing the presence of a mother who wasn’t able to be there for her. [13:48]<br />-Playing sports in high school, being approached by colleges offering scholarships, and the accident that brought everything to a halt. [17:04]<br />-Reflecting on that critical moment in her journey when everything changed, and her initial denial of it all. [22:18]<br />-The hard transition Alana faced upon returning home after rehab. [30:05]<br />-How taking a chance shortcut led to Alana’s magical moment when she was at her lowest point. [35:25]<br />-Mourning her loss with grace, moving forward, and developing a new dream. [38:47] <br />-Alana’s journey to the Paralympics and beyond, her insights on risk-taking, and final words of wisdom.

            "description": "In today’s episode, we speak with with writer, speaker, and soul-blogger Justine Musk, who has long been exploring the heroine’s journey in her work. She’s bold, honest, raw, and her story is an uncanny fit of the heroine’s arc. <br /><br />Justine found her true voice and power as a creative leader after rising up from her own personal underworld. She shares how we can look to myths for guidance and offers advice for putting yourself out there. Her insights on our relationship to emotions, what she calls “non-predatory” power and leadership, and why saying 'no' is so important as a woman will blow you away. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Justine’s early years: A small town, bookish girl who couldn’t wait to grow up. Early influences, teenage awkwardness, and learning to stand up for herself. [4:30]<br />-Coming into her own in her college years, wondering where she belonged, plus her awareness of the disconnect between how people were perceiving her and how she perceived herself. [9:14]<br />-The story of goddess Persephone and why Justine connects so strongly with her. [12:52]<br />-The benefit in connecting to myth, “post-traumatic growth”, and Justine’s insights on dealing with pain. [18:33]<br />-How Justine emerged stronger and more empowered after descending to her lowest point. [22:43]<br />-Justine’s advice for putting yourself out there, plus why it’s important for women to be unconventional. [27:02]<br />-Taking a closer look at feminine authority and leadership, and the power of saying ‘no’. [32:23]<br />-On women’s relationship to emotions and feelings (especially in the workplace).

In this episode, even our host admits to feeling that way sometimes, thinking it’s “too late” because she's already thirty. But thirty is around the magical time that artist and illustrator Lisa Congdon had her artistic revival. After working many years in education, she felt like a part of her wasn’t being fed. On a fluke she took an art class with her brother, and the experience changed her life. <br /><br />Lisa is best known for her colorful abstract paintings, intricate line drawings, pattern design and hand lettering, as well as her work as an author. She and Majo cover some topics Lisa hasn’t shared on a podcast before, including the unsexy parts of her work and challenges she still grapples with, and discuss why some women can be so afraid to step into their creative power.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Lisa’s early years: A young girl eager to please and figure out her place, her awkward teenage years, and the layers of self-doubt and insecurity she had to shed. [4:34]<br />-“Is this really what I want to be doing?” Lisa’s insights on her early career and the creative outlet she sought to feel “fed”. [10:58]<br />-The fluke that triggered her creativity and path to becoming an artist. [15:02]<br />-On deserving to be a creative, exploring loneliness, and opening oneself up to the world. [18:34]<br />-Some of the internal challenges Lisa faced, including thinking of herself as a victim. [24:41]<br />-Lisa’s advice to Majo on coming out of the creative closet. [28:46]<br />-What defines an artist? Plus, conflicting thoughts on sharing your work via social media. [33:33]<br />-The unsexy parts of Lisa’s world as an artist.

Jesse Genet was one of them, and today she’s the Designer, Founder, and CEO of Lumi, a company that lets you easily brand your own packaging. Her journey to entrepreneurship started in high school – she basically petitioned herself out of her senior year and drove across the country to L.A. with nothing but a dream and her 1969 Lincoln convertible.<br /><br />Jesse is a perfect example of a perpetual learner, constantly putting herself in uncomfortable situations in order to grow. She offers great counterintuitive advice to women who are seeking to be more creative and take more risks, and as a bonus, she’s straight up hilarious.  <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Jesse Genet growing up – a serious girl who wanted to be taken seriously. [3:32]<br />-Going through life phases early and fast, plus the turning point for her creativity. [7:32]<br />-How Jesse deftly figured out a way to leave high school early, and other evidence of an independent spirit.

We all know this, and yet so many of us hold ourselves to idealized standards of very disciplined people with high willpower. In a perfect world, maybe we’d actually be like that. But the truth is that even after you design your ritual and test it out, eventually it will morph, lessen, or decay altogether. This is completely natural.<br /><br />We have to design for the maintenance of our rituals as much as the creation of them. In this flash wisdom episode, host Majo talks to us about the importance of self-compassion and shares three things that have helped her develop a “reset” mindset when rituals fall to the wayside.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Check out and pre-order the new ebook: The Magical Effects of Morning and Evening Rituals, shipping on December 8 – plenty of time to order as a Christmas gift!

Lynsey Addario is a photojournalist who has photographed women under the Taliban, documented misogyny in the Congo, and been on the ground in Afghanistan after 9/11. From capturing the lives of transgender prostitutes in New York to her continued work on Syrian refugees and those displaced by war, Lynsey seeks to do justice for her subjects by capturing the true essence of their humanity.  <br /><br />Lynsey is also a New York Times bestselling author. Her memoir, It’s What I Do: A Photographer’s Life of Love and War, is so filled with vivid details and vulnerability, including her very close call as a hostage in Libya, that Steven Spielberg will soon be directing a movie based on her life starring Jennifer Lawrence. Lynsey’s spirit and drive will inspire you to recognize the unique impulses and passions we all have inside of us. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Growing up with parents who encouraged her to express herself, follow her dreams, and learn things for herself. [4:19]<br />-Receiving her first camera, becoming a self-taught photographer, and breaking into the business (which involved sneaking a shot of Madonna). [8:10]<br />-How Lynsey found her calling early on, and the inspiring purpose that drives her.

            "description": "Rituals are growing, evolving things with their own stubborn intelligence. That’s why the same exact rituals are hard to sustain over time. Since we are constantly changing with the months, seasons, and our environments, it makes sense to allow our rituals to organically change along with us. This approach is not only more realistic, forgiving, and practical, but it honors our naturally changing feminine energy. <br /><br />Majo described in Part 4 how to design your morning and evening rituals after identifying actions that aligned with your deeper desires. Now it’s time to anticipate and even welcome change. In this flash wisdom episode, Majo shares three principles that will help you add flexibility and fluidity to your rituals in a way that honors your body’s natural rhythms.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Check out and pre-order the new ebook: The Magical Effects of Morning and Evening Rituals.

            "description": "If you’re looking to understand your creativity and how it connects to your roots, this interview will surely spark some ideas and inspiration for you. Bethany Yellowtail is an influential Native fashion designer who shares her Crow and Northern Cheyenne heritage with the utmost sensitivity and care. When our host first stumbled upon her, Majo was struck by Bethany’s work and its beautiful celebration of Native American culture (without the ickiness of appropriation). <br /><br />They cover what it was like for Bethany growing up as one of the only Native girls in a mostly white public school, how she envisioned her brand and met her co-founder, and the inspiration behind her artist collective. Not only is she carving out an entirely new space in the fashion industry, but she’s doing so in a way that is positively impacting Native communities. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Bethany as a little girl: An old soul growing up on the Crow Indian Reservation. [4:43]<br />-On her parents and Native heritage, and dealing with racist mentalities that still exist to this day. [8:52]<br />-The extreme culture shock of her college years in L.A. and the emergence of her unique brand. [12:51]<br />-Bethany’s business partner who arrived via “divine intervention” and the launch of their first ecommerce products. [17:26]<br />-Her point of view around authentic native representation in fashion, plus the lessons she learned working for other companies. [21:21]<br />-How Bethany’s work is a way of sharing her culture, and how she deals with criticism. [25:03]<br />-On the theme of reclamation and how it relates to modern-day issues impacting Native communities. [31:39]<br />-Bethany shares about the inspiration and vision behind her artist collective.

In the last episode of this series we identified actions that align with your deeper desires.

            "description": "Our speakers often hold up a big mirror, sometimes revealing traits within us that need to be developed or amplified. Eileen Carey is a super feminist who offers that experience as an outspoken, unapologetic woman with a thirst for power. An overachiever who doesn’t always follow the rules, Eileen is CEO of Glassbreakers, which provides solutions for companies that want to keep their employees diverse and engaged by tackling diversity at the corporate level.<br /><br />Eileen comes from a long line of strong, opinionated women, and she continues in their tradition. In her interview she shares her thoughts on the fluidity of gender, drops some tough-love for women who feel like they can’t completely be themselves at work, and talks about the difference between career and corporate feminism in a way that is refreshingly direct and authentic. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Eileen’s powerful upbringing: Coming from a long line of strong and rebellious women. [4:02]<br />-On her independent and strong-willed personality, speaking up despite labels of being bossy or bitchy, and being comfortable with being controversial. [9:27]<br />-College years and discovering her true passions, plus the elite job she found on Craigslist that opened the doors of power to her in Manhattan. [14:53]<br />-Eileen shares about her thirst for power and how that guided her when the recession hit and her career became uncertain. [19:39]<br />-On being the “token millennial” during Occupy Wall Street, plus stories of Eileen’s mom the “corporate feminist”. [24:53]<br />-A lively discussion on masculine vs feminine in work cultures, and Eileen’s critical advice to jobseekers. [28:49]<br />-The value of diversity – One of the main catalysts for starting Glassbreakers. [34:20]<br />-The rock-bottom years: Eileen shares how moments of darkness in her life led her to make (good) drastic decisions. [39:13]<br />-Eileen’s lifelong passion for feminist causes and her thoughts on Hillary being the most overqualified candidate.

Spiritual traditions all over the world have told us to “transcend” pleasure, or at the very least not get too attached to it. Our American culture built on puritanical principles makes us feel wary of anything that’s too pleasurable, or that comes through pleasure versus hard work. Layer on gender, and we have a whole other conversation about so many of us women (especially good girls) who feel guilty about experiencing pleasure. <br /><br />In this flash wisdom episode, Majo describes how our morning and evening rituals become the pleasurable bookends to our career work, revealing how pleasure and discipline aren’t mutually exclusive.

A user experience researcher at Google, Nancy found her way to happiness and stability only after bridging a new and bewildering culture, bouncing around foster homes and living on the streets, and coming to terms with her broken childhood. <br /><br />You won’t believe the magical, serendipitous encounter with the MIT Media Lab that changed (and potentially saved) her life, revealing an aptitude for computers and design at a young age. Another big theme from her interview is the struggle she faced with her mom and how she was able to heal that relationship – a true hallmark of the heroine’s journey. Nancy is real, resourceful, and she has an incredible story to share.<br /><br />Show Notes: <br />-An inquisitive daughter of immigrants: Nancy’s early years in Boston surrounded by her Haitian culture. [4:33]<br />-Feeling confused, behind, and like an outsider as she tried to bridge American culture, plus the remarkable outcome of running away. [10:35]<br />-How she got connected to Computer Clubhouse, an MIT program where she learned to produce music, code, use photoshop, build robots, and lead her peers. [16:28]<br />-The lowest point: Bouncing around between being homeless and different foster homes. [19:02]<br />-The role of art and design as her only respite during a phase of anger and loneliness. [24:32]<br />-How she chose to get revenge on the foster care system, and her struggle to afford college. [28:24]<br />-Finding her passion, acknowledging her skills (despite stereotypes), and taking first steps to healing the relationship with her mother. [34:44]<br />-Moving forward and making amends, plus her decision to “show love through technology”. [42:49]<br />-How the earthquake in Haiti affected Nancy and her family, and the growth she experienced as a result.

When we hear about the daily do’s of others (especially successful people of today) it can be inspiring, but it can also make you feel kind of shitty if you’re struggling to nail down your own. <br /><br />We all make mistakes in how we approach and think about rituals— from the time we set them to how we relate to them after we “fail.” In this flash wisdom episode (part 2 in the Designing Rituals series), our host Majo proposes a key shift in our orientation and relationship to rituals with a feminine approach that honors all that is fluid and cyclical, and in way that promotes self-compassion.<br /><br />-Check out and pre-order the new ebook: The Magical Effects of Morning and Evening Rituals (available at mariamolfino.com/rituals).

Her clients include Wes Anderson, Dave Eggers, Penguin Books, The New York Times, Tiffany & Co., the list goes on and on. <br /><br />She recently released her book, In Progress, where she shares her creative process, how her career unfolded, and how each opportunity leads to the next. Jessica and Majo may have only scratched the surface in this interview, but they cover a lot of juicy stuff plus wisdom and tips for the striving creative. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />–Growing up as a quiet art kid from a small town. [4:08]<br />–On Jessica’s work ethic, the awkwardness of high school, and her book, In Progress. [10:13]<br />–How her parents’ divorce made her a kinder person, and why “oversharing” is a huge part of who Jessica is. [14:53]<br />–The shock of criticism: Being told she wasn’t “good enough” and how she responded. [20:16]<br />–Dealing with competition in art school, doing lots of internships, plus a great pro tip for students. [26:30]<br />–Going all in: The illustration promo she put together to get noticed, and how it paid off. [31:44]<br />–On working insane hours, being upfront with her boss about what was important to her, and how hard it was to quit. [42:16]<br />–Diving into freelancing full-time and being her own boss: How Jessica dealt with doubt and her biggest fear.

But she soon realized she was only pushing herself to avoid the fact that she felt lost and creatively unfulfilled. When the chance came to take a creative side project to the next level, she took it and launched Spitfire Athlete, a strength training and weightlifting app of thousands of users that helps women build physical and mental strength. <br /><br />Nidhi and her co-founder have created a community of women that focuses on reconnecting with your body and building a confident mindset. What’s just as special is that they did it their own way, going against the “founder myth” that tells us we have to raise a buttload of money from VCs (most of whom are men). For you good girls with a passionate creative side project wondering whether to take the leap, Nidhi offers some wonderful advice. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Nidhi growing up: On being quiet and introverted, her love for sports, and testing her own limits. [3:38]<br />-The teacher who helped change her trajectory and what it was like being the only girl in her programming class. [8:05]<br />-Nidhi reflects on the reasons for holding herself back in the past, and why she forces herself to do things she’s afraid of. [12:46]<br />-On practice, intimidation, and the rigors of studying computer science at MIT. [16:38]<br />-Dealing with stress, the importance of rowing (exercise), plus   <br />-Nidhi’s brief encounter with “imposter syndrome”. [22:02]<br />-After college: Nidhi talks about feeling lost for a while, working a lot, and the encounter that forced her to decide between taking a chance and playing it safe. [27:46]<br />Starting Spitfire Athlete and a new phase of life. [34:12]<br />-From a super high to a frustrating low: Nidhi shares why buying into the “founder myth” and following a prescribed set of steps didn’t work for them (and what they did instead).

Many of us (especially women) find it difficult to ask for help or fear being a “burden” to anyone. As a result, we’re so eager to achieve financial independence that we often choose paths that focus more on financial reward than heart. <br /><br />Join Maria as she talks about the harm in being overly independent, sharing her own examples of how she grapples with this today. Learn how pride, fear, and the inner critic prevent us from following our most meaningful path in our quest for independence.

It has won 11 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and our own President has seen it. In today’s episode we hear from one of the show’s stars, Ariana DeBose, a woman who had the courage to follow her intuition, drop out of school, and fulfill her dreams. <br /><br />Ariana is a young, passionate, multi-talented woman with many creative projects already under her belt. We talk about her challenges as an outspoken girl and one of the only students of color in her peer group, her encounter with anorexia and the pressure she felt as a teenager to be perfect, and what it means to her to be a true creator. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Ariana’s childhood: Her early love for cinema and how she connects that love to her passion for theater today. [2:55]<br />-On being raised by a mother who treated her like an adult, never being afraid to ask questions, and her start with dancing. [10:24]<br />-The challenge that took a self-assured teen out of her comfort zone, plus Ariana’s perspective on needing approval from others.

[23:18]<br />-How she came to realize the importance of being there for the creation of projects she worked on, and making her broadway debut. [27:53]<br />-Lessons from the last six years: Not taking things too personally, knowing your own worth, and fighting stereotypes. [31:35]<br />-On what it means to Ariana to be a creator, and how it felt getting the part in Hamilton.

She shares about the pressure she once felt to repay her immigrant parents for their sacrifice, and how her “save the world” complex left her feeling stressed, angry, and unable to follow her true path. <br /><br />Listen to her story of the lesson she learned during her travels in India that helped reframe her perspective around pressure, and how small acts of kindness really can make a difference in the world and in yourself. Alleviate some of the pressure in your life by taking a step back and bringing this tendency into your awareness. <br /><br />Show Notes:  <br />-Download Maria’s free Creative Confidence Playbook at mariamolfino.com/free-playbook<br />-Music by Lucia Lilikoi at lucia.bandcamp.com",

            "description": "It’s not uncommon for girls who grow up in a patriarchal society to wonder if being a boy would be better; to see masculinity as more powerful than femininity. That was the case for Emily LaFave Olson, but a conversation with her mom led her to a realization that changed her life (and her perspective on the feminine).<br /><br />Emily is a fierce entrepreneur whose choice to take back her maiden name and become co-CEOs with her husband sets her apart as a woman unafraid to ask for what she wants. We cover a lot of ground in this episode, like how to manage the voice inside our heads that tells us we’re not good enough or smart enough, why women often struggle to ask for what they want, and how to get in touch with the inner feminine in a hyper-masculine world.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Emily’s childhood: Growing up close to her dad, a natural leader, and always believing she could do whatever a boy could do.   [3:14]<br />-Teaching herself to cook from magazines and beginning to see the world through the lense of food.   [9:30]<br />-College years, their first business, and feeling “not smart enough”.   [13:12]<br />-Why she had to reach out to her parents to help reconcile her inner critic and her huge realization about the power and strength of the feminine.   [20:40]<br />-Standing up to fear: When and how it clicked that she needed to change her name back and become co-CEOs with her husband.   [25:57]<br />-How to get what you really want, plus the importance of her husband’s participation in her vision.   [30:55]<br />-On internalized patriarchy, making Big Asks, and why women have a hard time demanding what we want.   [33:52]<br />-How to get in touch with the inner-feminine while surrounded by hyper-masculinity at work.

            "description": "What is chronic stress? Unlike acute stress, chronic stress is constant and low-grade, wearing and tearing on the nervous and immune systems over time. You may not even realize you’re being affected, but studies show that chronic stress makes it harder for us to be creative, think outside the box, and be mentally flexible. <br /><br />In this flash wisdom episode, host Maria Molfino explains how this form of stress cripples our energy and willpower, inviting the inner critic to come out and play. Practice some compassionate self-inquiry to reveal the impact chronic stress has over your life and learn basic steps you can take to keep it in check.<br /><br />Show Notes:  <br />-Download Maria’s free Creative Confidence Playbook at mariamolfino.com/free-playbook<br />-Music by Lucia Lilikoi at lucia.bandcamp.com",

For Eileen Fisher, it’s been her voice and her courage to lean into difficult conversations. This design magnate has scaled an incredible organization that generates over $300 million a year in revenue, but she didn’t have an easy start or a path paved with roses.<br /><br />What makes her shine even more is her passion for sustainability, empowering women, and living life with purpose. In her interview you’ll learn the conditions she’s created for her success, her thoughts on purpose and embodiment, and the principles that guide her leadership today. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Eileen’s upbringing: Early desires for a simplified wardrobe, the subconscious influence of Catholic school uniforms, and making her own prom dress.   [3:25]<br />-How she used her math skills to help her in business and in finding creative expression.   [8:23]<br />-Falling in love with the concept of simplicity and putting together her first pieces.   [11:47]<br />-How a design-thinking mindset gave her the confidence to move her ideas forward.   [16:12]<br />-Eileen’s biggest challenges starting out (and how she overcame most of them through sheer resourcefulness).   [17:31]<br />-Overcoming her fear of communication and reclaiming her voice.   [22:23] <br />-On being a mom, getting divorced, and trying to run a business (the toughest part of her journey).   [26:18] <br />-The quality that allowed her to keep going during the hard times.   [30:38]<br />-Meaning, purpose, and other principles that guide Eileen’s leadership today.   [33:12]<br />-Beyond profits: The importance of sustainability, organic materials, and supporting women’s bodies.   [39:15]<br />-Eileen’s daily advice for supporting relaxation (which in turn, supports creativity).

            "description": "How did Marian Goodell go from studying photography and creative writing to becoming the CEO of Burning Man, one of the biggest sociocultural experiments of our time? The link is fascinating, especially for those who are both creative and analytical and who aren’t following a straight and predictable path. Find out how Marian deals with criticism (i.e., she is too impatient and her tone is too \"demanding\") and how she filters feedback. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />-Marian as a little girl: Learning self-acceptance, how to embrace differences, and enjoying the perks of being a fiery redhead. [2:34]<br />-The role of Marian’s family in shaping her to become a strong, confident woman. [8:47]<br />-On attending an all-girls college, running for student body, and the first time she decided to be a leader. [13:16]<br />-“My role as a CEO is very much that of a storyteller”: How Marian’s creative, analytical side made her the right woman for the job. [16:37]<br />-On being a “cat herder” and what that means to her as a leader, and other leadership qualities. [21:47]<br />-Why Marian cares about providing opportunities, giving people the benefit of the doubt, and sharing differing perspectives. [27:04]<br />-Stories of her father and his participation in Burning Man 2008 (a year before he passed away). [30:32]<br />-Marian and Maria discuss failure and the fear of rejection, the importance of creative confidence, and the challenges (and benefits) of collaboration. [35:14]<br />-On feminism and fathers, and finding the balance between feminine and masculine leadership traits. [40:30]<br />-Looking beyond gender: Taking a hard look at qualities like patience, aggression, compassion. [47:26]<br />-How Marian filters and utilizes criticism/feedback. [52:38]<br />-Have you ever felt like an imposter? The inner critic vs empowering voice. [57:44]<br />-Burning Man: Marian’s vision for the project’s future, her favorite principles (Leave No Trace and Radical Self-Expression), and being poised in the world as a catalyst for social change.

That’s the question that echoed in Dr. Vivienne Ming’s mind when she contemplated killing herself, before she became a woman, mom, neuroscientist, technologist, and LGBT advocate. Dr. Ming shares more about the wisdom that saved her life, and how it led her to focus on the one superpower that predicts success over and over again. <br /><br />Show Notes:<br />- Vivienne’s upbringing, not living up to expectations, and realizing she was “different.”  [1:30]<br />- The lowest point — Suicide, and why she decided not to do it.   [4:39]<br />- On her larger-than-life father and his example of “living a life of substance.”   [7:54]<br />- How intrinsic motivation fueled her shift away from the brink of suicide.   [12:02]<br />- From flunking out of college to getting perfect scores in everything the second time around.   [14:59]<br />- On her year at the Machine Perception Lab and the start of her professional success.   [19:08]<br />- Learning to counter her destructive-perfectionism through perseverance. [21:31]<br />- On feeling free to follow what she believes to be right.   [25:09]<br />- Women’s tendency to worry about how they are being perceived rather than whether they are being true to themselves.   [26:51]<br />- On meeting her wife in graduate school and opening up about wanting to be a woman.   [31:13]<br />- The immediate effects of Vivienne’s gender transition – losing her position at Stanford, being treated differently by close friends and strangers alike, and observing implicit gender biases.   [35:38]<br />- Vivienne’s work at Socos: Studying the predictors of success and optimizing life outcomes.   [42:43]<br />- Defining a meta-learner and the main categories that predict success.   [47:33]<br />- How to strengthen our meta-learning abilities.   [52:49]<br />- Vivienne’s perspective on how society influences gender roles and the enduring disparities between men and women.

How does she overcome the ocean at night, and above all, the doubts swirling in her own mind? Roz Savage, environmental advocate and TED speaker, shares the specific process that set her on this wild adventure – one that you can do in under ten minutes.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />- Roz’s upbringing as the perpetual new girl and her skill at jumping through childhood’s hoops.   [1:51]  <br />- How Roz got stuck for 11 years pretending to be something she didn’t want to be.   [10:00]<br />- On the epiphany (inspired by a simple self-help exercise) that changed her life. And why she waited to act.   [12:58] <br />- From self-sabotaging to her lowest point, to finding transformational confidence and her life’s calling.  [17:39] <br />- How the unlikely idea emerged to use ocean rowing as her platform for bringing environmental awareness.   [24:46] <br />- Going into the first race (as the only solo female) and the challenges she faced.   [29:35] <br />- How Roz destroyed self-limiting beliefs and redefined what she was capable of.  [35:50] <br />- On surprising herself, being grateful for challenges, and choosing to see her discomfort as a clear sign of success.   [39:15]<br />- The story of her emotional decision to be rescued when she really needed it.   [44:11]<br />- The toxicity of criticism: Roz’s theory on why people criticize, dealing with with her own inner critic, and how she stays true to her vision.   [49:22]<br />- Understanding internal motivations and taking ownership over your life.   [56:13]<br />- On the importance of amplifying heroine journeys, being open to spiritual perspectives, and balancing feminine and masculine energies.   [1:00:55]<br />- Looking to the future: Roz’s belief that stories like hers help others to challenge old paradigms.   [1:09:35]<br />- Roz breaks down the exercise that changed her life and discusses the importance of crafting your own story.
