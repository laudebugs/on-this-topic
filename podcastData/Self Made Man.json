Many of you didn’t. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, Wall Street is here. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rules and regulations required for institutions to buy, sell, trade, and custody crypto assets have been put in place over the past 24 months. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can now buy and sell Bitcoin on Square’s Cash App, and two weeks ago PayPal announced that they will be offering the same ability to their 300 million global customers. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last month, banks around the country were given the ability to use crypto as well. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the dollar being printed away through trillions in stimulus, anyone and everyone who is paying attention realize that Bitcoin is about to take its legitimate place in the global economy. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, if you buy before they do, you win. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help bring you up to speed on what’s happening, I’m joined by my friend Teeka Tiwari who’s the Founder of my favorite crypto research publication. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teeka has a team of 20 full-time researchers who do nothing but research the crypto market to find the best assets to invest in. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been a customer of their work since 2017, and I wouldn’t want to invest in this industry without them. </span></p> <div><strong>Resources:</strong></div> <div><a href=\"http://palmbeachbitcoin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://PalmBeachBitcoin.com&source=gmail&ust=1605022808228000&usg=AFQjCNGIKI1AyP9nRGoDVGNVuka-Z-XWyw\"> PalmBeachBitcoin.com</a></div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Music:</strong></div> <div>Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/more-plastic-let-me-go-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/more-plastic-let-me-go-ncs-release&source=gmail&ust=1605022808228000&usg=AFQjCNFM5Ufg-fbzgF9kvaIU1wvhZ1qn2A\">More Plastic - Let Me Go [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds<br /> Free Download/Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/LetMeGo\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ncs.io/LetMeGo&source=gmail&ust=1605022808228000&usg=AFQjCNFF7M4BwXpYyoBVYqbIZ1gh0cBIkg\">http://ncs.io/LetMeGo</a><br />  Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/hoUtpjA5HLg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://youtu.be/hoUtpjA5HLg&source=gmail&ust=1605022808228000&usg=AFQjCNGZu06E6epuu7raBD9SknBKBd-rww\">http://youtu.be/hoUtpjA5HLg</a></div>",

They’re only accepting 60 members, and the caliber of people are going to be incredible.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://zacollective.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">zacollective.com</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Song: <a href=\"Max%20Brhon%20-%20Pain%20[NCS%20Release]\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Max Brhon - Pain [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds<br /> Free Download/Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/MBPain\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://ncs.io/MBPain</a><br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wf3XPionPXE\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://youtu.be/wf3XPionPXE</a></p>",

As you can imagine, there are only two things a strong surfer might fear… Shallow coral reefs, and sharks.</p> <p>Well that morning, fate stepped in as a 14 foot tiger shark attacked Bethany, severing her left arm in the process.</p> <p>She obviously survived, but now she had a choice to make…</p> <p>As Tony Robbins likes to say, you can let things happen to you in life, or you can let them happen for you.</p> <p>Thankfully, Bethany chose to accept, to adapt, and to fight for what she wanted as she always had.</p> <p>One year later, she took home first place at her next professional event and by doing so, she became a role model to millions around the world.</p> <p>She has shared her story on Oprah, Ellen, and the Tonight show, and today she’s generously offered her time to share it with you.</p> <p>And I’d highly recommend that you gather the family together and watch her incredibly inspiring move, Unstoppable, on Netflix, iTunes, and Amazon.</p> <p>With all of the negativity surrounding us today online and offline, this is one movie that will make an unforgettable impact on you and your kids.</p> <p>Today, Bethany is a wife and mother of two, and she and her husband have dedicated their lives to mentoring and inspiring as many people as they can through an awesome online program you can learn more about at BethanyHamilton.com.</p> <p>Now on a personal note, I wanted to share some thoughts about this interview that I think about often...</p> <p>Bethany has reached a point in her life where she doesn’t want to talk about the shark attack any more, and that was the case during this interview as well.</p> <p>On one hand, I completely understand where she’s coming from. That event took place 17 years ago, and it has to be incredibly difficult to have a moment in time, define the rest of your life.</p> <p>You’re going to reach a point when it’s time to move on.</p> <p>There are chapters in my life that are over and that I don’t want to discuss either.</p> <p>But at the same time, I’m torn because this part of her life’s story is the catalyst for everything good that’s taken place since then.</p> <p>It’s given her the opportunity to make a positive impact on millions of young adults and athletes and around the world, and this part of her story is the reason why she’s been on Oprah, and Ellen, and all of the biggest platforms in the world.</p> <p>This is obviously an incredibly personal decision that is largely driven by your personal priorities in life.</p> <p>But if you want to build a business, that process starts with getting attention, and I think it’s a mistake to throw away the story that’s literally grabbed the attention of the world for nearly two decades.</p> <p>Either way, Bethany is a rock star in life and one of the rare role models in the world today who you can safely point your children towards.</p> <p>So watch Unstoppable tonight, and please help me welcome Bethany Hamilton.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://bethanyhamilton.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">BethanyHamilton.com</a><br /> Follow Bethany on <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/SurferBethanyHamilton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/bethanyhamilton/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://twitter.com/bethanyhamilton\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.netflix.com/title/81097552#:~:text=2019PG%201h%2040mSports,surfing%20and%20her%20personal%20life.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch Unstoppable</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/heuse-tom-wilson-ignite-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heuse & Tom Wilson - Ignite [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds<br /> Free Download/Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/Ignite\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://NCS.io/Ignite</a><br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/zbqgv0mMfwk\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://youtu.be/zbqgv0mMfwk</a></p>",

            "description": "<p>One of the most transformative pieces of technology that has opened the gates of entrepreneurship during the past ten years, has been the invention of drag-and-drop funnel building software.</p> <p>Platforms like LeadPages and then ClickFunnels, gave brand new entrepreneurs the ability to create effective sales funnels for the very first time, without the need to learn how to code, or hire an expensive development team.</p> <p>The result has been an absolute explosion in new online businesses which has been awesome.</p> <p>But many of these platforms are starting to show their age.</p> <p>New features are few and far between, the code base has been pushed to its capacity, and customer service can take days to provide a response.</p> <p>Well a few months ago, my friend Jordan called me up to tell me about a new system he’d been working on called DropFunnels, and I was completely blown away.</p> <p>By the time I was done looking under the hood, I came to a very simple conclusion…</p> <p>Any business owner who cares about sales and revenue, is eventually going to end up using DropFunnels. Why? Because you don’t have a choice.</p> <p>As you’re going to hear today, DropFunnels has several important advantages over their competitors…</p> <p>The primary one is that it’s the first and only, drag-and-drop funnel builder based on WordPress, which is Google’s preferred website engine.</p> <p>This means that your pages load up to 95% faster which is one of the single biggest factors when it comes to your conversion rate and the cost of your ads.</p> <p>The second, is that your funnels and pages can finally get indexed by Google which will provide you with free organic traffic for the first time.</p> <p>These two features alone mean that the exact same funnel you’re using right now could be converting significantly higher by simply importing it into DropFunnels.</p> <p>At the end of the day, I was so impressed that I hired DropFunnels to import my funnels onto their platform, and I invested in the company.</p> <p>DropFunnels is officially the first and only software platform that I’ve put my name on in the past 15 years.</p> <p>So without further ado, let me introduce you to the Founder, Jordan Mederich, as he fills you in on everything you need to know about this game-changing software that everyone needs to use.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://dropfunnels.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">DropFunnels.com</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dropfunnels/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Join the DropFunnels Facebook Group</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/xaia-breakdown-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xaia, Rain Man, Oly - Breakdown [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CyD8hAjj8L8\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/CyD8hAjj8L8</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/Breakdown\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/Breakdown</a></p>",

            "description": "<p>Hey gang, and welcome back to the show.</p> <p>One of the fastest-growing markets in the world is the CBD market. CBD stands for Cannabidiol, which is one of the many chemical compounds found in the cannabis and hemp plants.</p> <p>Cannabinoids can provide incredible health benefits ranging from improved mood, to better sleep, to pain and inflammation reduction, and they’re completely safe.</p> <p>In fact, your body and brain have built-in cannabinoid receptors which means we have a symbiotic relationship with this plant.</p> <p>As a result of its legalization here in the US a few years ago, you can now walk into any local gas station or grocery store and find all kinds of products from water and soda, to alcohol and candy bars, that contain CBD.</p> <p>But there’s a scam going on in the industry right now.</p> <p>Most CBD oils are dead.</p> <p>They have been pulled out of the plant and processed using heat or chemicals that denature and destroy their chemical structure, rendering them useless to your body.</p> <p>Which means you’re paying extra money, for a product that simply doesn’t work.</p> <p>On top of that, most CBD oils are manufactured from hemp plants that are grown in mass using pesticides.</p> <p>So how do you create a product that will stand out in a crowded market filled with cheap products? How do you earn and keep a loyal customer base in an industry that is becoming a commodity?</p> <p>Well, today I’d like to introduce you to the founder of a company who’s doing exactly that.</p> <p>Ted Moskovitz from AmmaHealing.co.</p> <p>Amma is changing the CBD industry in terms of quality, source verification, and use cases.</p> <p>In fact, I was so impressed by what they’re doing, I decided to become a seed investor before they launched last year.</p> <p>So if you’d like a valuable lesson in marketing and product differentiation, and if you’d like to try a real CBD product that actually works, please enjoy this episode with Ted Moscovitz, and stay tuned until the end for a valuable discount code I’d like to give you as a listener of the show so you can try Amma’s incredible products for yourself.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://ammahealing.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">AmmaHealing.co</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/jonth-collapse-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jonth - Collapse [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/Collapse\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/Collapse</a></p>",

            "description": "<p>Soooo how are you enjoying 2020 so far?</p> <p>Calm? Relaxing? Filled with fun and adventure?</p> <p>Not so much? Ya me too.</p> <p>So this last Sunday, Michelle and I had a pretty amazing group of friends out on the boat, many of whom have been previous guests on this podcast... Christine Hassler, Stef Sifandos, Tah and Kole Whitty, and Mike Chang to name just a few.</p> <p>We talked about the events that have happened so far this year. We talked about the murder of George Floyd, and how this tragic event can be turned into a force for good.</p> <p>And as we continued to talk, we realized that every single person on that boat, without exception, was in a period of personal transition.</p> <p>Some people were stranded in Austin away from their home because of the health crisis.</p> <p>Others are in the process of moving into a new house for one reason or another, and others were in the middle of changing careers.</p> <p>There were 11 people on that boat, and not a single one of them was going about their lives as usual.</p> <p>2020 is a year of transition for the world, and so far, that transition has been quite chaotic.</p> <p>The amount of trauma and fear being created in people right now is going to last a generation, and unfortunately, I don’t think this trend is going to slow down anytime soon with the election just 5 months away.</p> <p>So what can we do about it? How can we heal a nation and come out of this stronger, wiser, closer, and healthier on the other side?</p> <p>Well I have a few ideas, but in reality, the answers already exist, and they have for a good 2,000 years now.</p> <p>Whether you’re religious or not… Christian, Muslim, Buddist, or Atheist, the solution to every problem humanity creates, remains the same…</p> <p>Love, and forgiveness.</p> <p>They’re not an easy solution. Love and forgiveness both require strength, courage, wisdom, maturity, and selflessness.</p> <p>But at the end of the day, they are the only thing that allows true healing to occur, instead of perpetuating cycles of trauma, pain, and retaliation.</p> <p>A month ago, before the events of this past week, I had a chance to interview someone I consider to be one of the most interesting men in the world.</p> <p>His name is Victor Marx.</p> <p>I found Victor years ago on YouTube when I stumbled upon a video of him.</p> <p>Another man has a pistol pressed against his forehead, ready to fire.</p> <p>In that moment, Victor managed to grab the gun and point in back towards the aggressor in less than a second. If you blinked, you missed it.</p> <p>And as soon as it was over, applause and gasps of disbelief erupted from the audience.</p> <p>You see, Victor is a pastor, but not the kind you’d find at your local church.</p> <p>He was tortured as a child, and spent much of his youth lost and outraged at the world.</p> <p>Until he found Jesus, which became the defining moment in his life.</p> <p>Today, he has a beautiful wife and children, and in many ways, everything to lose.</p> <p>But instead of living in comfort, he chooses to travel to the most dangerous places in the world like Iraq and Afghanistan, with a gun, a Bible, and a bullet-proof vest.</p> <p>He is a white man in a foriegn land, putting his life on the line to fight evil, and to rescue little brown girls from sex slavery and torture.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Because love and forgiveness. Because that’s what he received from Christ, and because that’s the only real way to heal the world.</p> <p>Please help me welcome, Victor Marx.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://victormarx.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">VictorMarx.com</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.freeburmarangers.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">FreeBurmaRangers.org</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/tinoma-find-you-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tinoma - Find You [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/GW_TLXbZmz4\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/GW_TLXbZmz4</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/TFindYou\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/TFindYou</a></p>",

It continues…</p> <p>We might take a personality test that tells us we’re an introvert… Or you might use your astrological profile to justify some of your behaviors, actions, or decisions.</p> <p>And while it’s critical that we do seek an identity, what’s really important to understand, is that the identity you ultimately create is not a result of what happens to you, or when or where you were born, but that it’s completely under your control.</p> <p>Ultimately, your identity is nothing more than the collection of stories you’ve created about yourself and accepted as true.</p> <p>And those stories are changeable.</p> <p>The nerd in school can become the tech billionaire.</p> <p>The single child from an abusive family can become a loving parent to many children.</p> <p>A poor kid from the hood can become a celebrity business tycoon.</p> <p>And an introvert can build an audience of millions of fans, and use their voice to change the world.</p> <p>You can let these stories define you, or you can define the stories.</p> <p>How?</p> <p>Well that’s what we’re going to talk about today with our guest, Benjamin Hardy.</p> <p>Ben has spent the past few years studying personality types, identities, and the processes by which we create our personal beliefs.</p> <p>These beliefs determine our expectations and our actions.</p> <p>And our expectations and actions, ultimately determine the kind of life we live.</p> <p>If you want to change your life, you have to start by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself.</p> <p>This is one of the most important interviews you’ll ever hear, so without further ado, please help me welcome, Benjamin Hardy.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Isnt-Permanent-Self-Limiting-Beliefs-ebook/dp/B07N5H5C4N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personality Isn't Permanent: Break Free from Self-Limiting Beliefs and Rewrite Your Story</a><br /> <a href=\"http://benjaminhardy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">BenjaminHardy.com</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Doesnt-Work-Discover-Success-ebook/dp/B073P421QC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Willpower Doesn't Work: Discover the Hidden Keys to Success</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_psychology_of_your_future_self?language=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Gilbert - The Psychology of Your Future Self</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Man's Search for Meaning</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/aeden-um41k-aint-nobody-perfect-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aeden & Um41K - Ain't Nobody Perfect [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/qcayt_B8868\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/qcayt_B8868</a><br /> Free Download / <a href=\"http://ncs.io/ANP\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Stream: ncs.io/ANP</a></p>",

            "description": "<p>There are millions of people who are being forced or inspired to start their own business for the first time right now, and unfortunately, they’re walking into a jungle filled with landmines.</p> <p>The vast majority of them will spend the next 3-5 years trying to figure out what kind of business to start, what products to sell, how to create a marketing funnel, advertise online, and everything in between.</p> <p>The ones who keep going despite the failures and false starts, are the people who will eventually make it, and create a new life of freedom for themselves as a self-employed entrepreneur.</p> <p>With that in mind, what would I do if I had to start all over again?</p> <p>Well there is one business model that provides the best chance at replacing a 6 figure salary, and that is selling your product or service for a premium price of at least $3,000 to $5,000.</p> <p>For example, if you want to make $10,000 per month, then you only need to make two $5,000 sales to make that happen.</p> <p>But if you were trying to hit that same goal by selling a $49 Ebook, you’d have to make 200 sales every single month.</p> <p>And yes, making 2 sales per month at any price, is infinitely easier than making 200.</p> <p>This is a lesson I learned way back in my networking days and it completely changed my life.</p> <p>I went from struggling and trying to build a business selling supplements and health products, to selling access to investing seminars for $10,000 each.</p> <p>Within months I was making 7 figures as a distributor for that business because higher prices provides you with so many advantages…</p> <p>Higher profits, higher end customers, and the bigger margins you need to market, and still have plenty of money left over to pay your bills.</p> <p>So if I had to start all over again, I would build a business that offered a premium product, for a premium price.</p> <p>So how do you do that, well today we’re joined by Joel Erway who is arguably the best in the world at helping people quickly and easily create a high-ticket sales-based business.</p> <p>When I started to really study this business model again over the past few months, he’s the guy I called because he has the simplest, and most elegant business model I’ve found in this space.</p> <p>So let’s dive in, and let Joel teach you how you can build a brand new business from beginning to launch in less than 10 days, that has the potential to produce 6-7 figures per year in revenue with one single product and marketing funnel.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://highticketcourses.com/Mike\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">HighTicketCourses.com/Mike</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Irresistible-Offers-Marketing/dp/0982150024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Create Irresistible Offers: The Easiest Way on Earth to make Your Marketing Generate More Leads, Orders, and Sales</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/tokyo-machine-guy-arthur-get-up-ncs-release-promo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tokyo Machine & Guy Arthur - GET UP [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/HV7mLcsUp5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/HV7mLcsUp5U</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/GetUp\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/GetUp</a></p>",

They’re the difference between people who struggle and who just seem to make everything work.</p> <p>This is one of the few books I’ve found myself highlighting page after page in years.</p> <p>Now in today’s interview, we’re going to get into the practical side of starting a business from scratch which is equally valuable, but I’d highly recommend that you order a copy of Start From Zero because we didn’t even get a chance to dive into the deep inner work portion of the book that I’ve found so fascinating.</p> <p>Please help me welcome, Dane Maxwell.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/danemaxwellprofile\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a><br /> <a href=\"http://startfromzero.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">StartFromZero.com</a><br /> <a href=\"http://startfromzero.com/five\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">StartFromZero.com/Five</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/hylo-x-disfigure-im-here-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hylo x Disfigure - I'm Here [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4whPRKpbA4Q&list=PLQU0NciggdjzAA_-ZSRBIxD6Wcokn-8wp&index=19&t=0s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">youtu.be/4whPRKpbA4Q</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ncsounds?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">ncs.io/ImHere</a></p>",

            "description": "<p>The concept of community has made a dramatic shift over the past two months, hasn’t it?</p> <p>The sense of community we’d normally experience at work, or school, or simply going to the grocery store, or eating at a restaurant has been taken away.</p> <p>And they’ve been replaced with online communities.</p> <p>Work meetings have moved from boardrooms to zoom rooms.</p> <p>In many ways, as an online entrepreneur, things are largely the same. I still have a 20 foot commute to work every morning, and I still conduct business with my virtual team… Well virtually…</p> <p>But here’s what has changed…</p> <p>Micro communities have popped up online, and these communities are largely determined by your current mindset, mental state, goals, and sources of media consumption…</p> <p>For example, I’m in two private groups on WhatsApp…</p> <p>One group consists of entrepreneurs like Eben Pagan, Annie Lalla, Marie Forleo, Joe Polish, John Lee Dumas, Dean Gaziosi, etc… This group is focused on two things… Making sure everyone’s businesses are holding up, and the second, finding a way to help and serve the rest of society.</p> <p>The second group consists of friends of mine who have been through market crashes before, who have contacts in the military, and who are making sure everyone’s covered should a worst-case scenario take place.</p> <p>And then there’s a third group, which I’ll simply refer to as Facebook and the 3,500 friends I’m connected to on there.</p> <p>I don’t know about you, but my Facebook feed has become an absolute dumpster fire.</p> <p>It’s a full-on sewer pipe straight into the brain right now.</p> <p>Blame, finger-pointing, victim-hood, conspiracy theories, dispresect… All lead people to the same destination…</p> <p>A place filled with fear, disconnection, anger, frustration, trauma, and failure.</p> <p>You cannot think creatively when you’re looking at a virtual car wreck all day. You cannot lead, motivate, or inspire your team. You cannot solve your problems, create solutions, or wake up feeling empowered.</p> <p>Ultimately, your tribe will determine your destination, and after observing these different dynamics for the past two months, it’s become extremely clear to me that another option is needed.</p> <p>We all know the saying that you will get the results of the 5 people you spend the most time around.</p> <p>Well I want you to take a long hard look at who you’re spending your time around online, and on Netflix.</p> <p>Are you rummaging around in Facebook dumpster fire because you don’t know where else to go?</p> <p>Are you poisoning your mind with garbage like Tiger King every night?</p> <p>Yep, I watched it. On one hand it’s another car wreck you can’t look away from. And on the other, I felt like I’d just eaten a rotten meal that just poisoned my body.</p> <p>The most valuable asset you have right now is your brain, and your brain is a sponge that will soak up everything you expose it to, for better or worse.</p> <p>So I decided to create a new community. Something that was private and off of Facebook.</p> <p>It’s called Revvenue Mastermind, and the goal or Revvenue is simple…</p> <p>Over 100 A-players like the Founder of Sam Cart, two real estate billionaires… Two social media titans that run the campaigns for Brendon Bruchard and Russell Brunson, the best Facebook ad experts in the industry, the best YouTube ad agency owners, Robert Kiyosaki’s CPA, the best funnel builders, the best mindset coaches, and more…</p> <p>Have all joined Revvenue in the last 48 hours for two primary reasons…</p> <p>They want to be a part of a healthy community, and they want to surround themselves with other people who are focused on coming out of this situation bigger, better, wiser, and wealthier than before.</p> <p> </p> <p>There’s no talk about a virus in the group. There’s no finger pointing, politics, or blame. And there’s no conspiracy theories or negativity allowed.</p> <p>Every week, we jump on a live zoom call together as a group, and we solve your problems, we provide each other with support and ideas, and we share valuable connections, resources.</p> <p>This is a community that improves your life, in every single way, and it’s the most valuable asset you can access right now.</p> <p>If you’re listening to this podcast and if you’d like to join the group, just head to Revvenue.com. Revvenue is spelled with two V’s because our goal here is to rev up everyone’s revvenue so you can keep your bills paid, your employees paid, and the economy turning.</p> <p>There’s even a way you can turn Revvenue into your very own income stream, and you can learn more about that as well at Revvenue.com.</p> <p>If you’d like to join, there’s a nominal fee that we’re using to cover the costs of running the group, and to support several charities that are providing food and shelter for people who can’t afford to take care of themselves right now.</p> <p>Right now until this Saturday, you can get a 33% discount off the normal price we’ll be charging moving forward, so make sure you head to Revvenue.com to learn more ASAP.</p> <p>Now with that being said, we have a special guest on the show today who happens to be the world’s foremost expert on building communities.</p> <p>His name is Jono Bacon.</p> <p>Jono helps companies build healthy and thriving communities and cultures. He’s previously served as the Director of Community at Github, Canonical, and XPrize.</p> <p>His clients include Intel, Google, Sony, Deutsche Bank, Santander, and Hacker One.</p> <p>He is the author of a brand new book called, “People Powered - How Communities Can Supercharge Your Business, Brand, And Teams.”</p> <p>If you lead a community of any kind, or if you see the value in starting one right now, you’re about to learn how to do that from the foremost expert in the world.</p> <p>And yes, he’s also a Member of the Revvenue Mastermind.</p> <p>Please welcome, Jono Bacon.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://jonobacon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Jonobacon.com</a><br /> Follow Jono on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jonobacongram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/jonobacon\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonobacon\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">LinkedIn</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/People-Powered-Communities-Supercharge-Business/dp/1400214882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">People Powered: How Communities Can Supercharge Your Business, Brand, and Teams</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/netrum-colorblind-ft-halvorsen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netrum - Colorblind (feat.

Well if you are, you’re either closer than ever right now, or you’ve never been further apart.</p> <p>You’re now at home with someone 24/7.</p> <p>Your kids are there with you.</p> <p>The news is keeping everyone all fired up and in anger or fear.</p> <p>Everyone’s normal routines have gone out the window.</p> <p>You might have a friend or family member in the hospital, and there’s a good chance that you’re probably experiencing some financial stress to just add a nice little cherry on top.</p> <p>I can’t think of a situation that could put more stress on a couple than this crisis.</p> <p>Well if that’s the case, I’d encourage you to look at this as an opportunity to benefit from something I call, “forced change”.</p> <p>This is a time or experience in your life when you’re literally being forced to change who you are, how you act, what you think, and how you live your life.</p> <p>All of these stressors are going to magnify what was always present.</p> <p>If you were previously disconnected as a couple, then this crisis is going to magnify that.</p> <p>If you were doing awesome and in flow, then you’ve probably grown closer as a couple.</p> <p>But making that transition is certainly easier said than done.</p> <p>It’s going to require courage, it’s going to require vulnerability, and it’s going to require some long-overdue apologies and healing.</p> <p>Well today we’re joined by to amazing humans who were a part of my healing journey last year, and who have become incredibly dear friends as a result.</p> <p>As you’re about to hear, Tah and Kole Whitty have been through just about everything a person can go through in life.

They’ve dedicated their lives to healing themselves, and healing others, and they’ve become masters of their craft.</p> <p>As a result of their work, they also have one of the most amazing relationships you’ll ever see.</p> <p>So I asked them to come onto the show to help you, heal yours, whether it’s with your spouse, your co-workers, your kids, your family members, or simply the relationship you have with yourself.</p> <p>This crisis is an opportunity to face and change the challenges you have in your life.</p> <p>The ONLY way you lose during this period, is if you don’t take action and use it as a catalyst to learn and transform.</p> <p>If you do that, you’ve won.</p> <p>If you need help doing that, call Tah and Kole.</p> <p>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.gethelpquiz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://www.gethelpquiz.com/</a><br /> Follow Tah and Kole on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tahkole/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/TahKole\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a><br /> Text \"optimize\" to 22999 <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mentor-in-the-mirror/id1481060523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mentor in the Mirror Podcast</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NO5F4DQ/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The MindBody Code: How to Change the Beliefs that Limit Your Health, Longevity, and Success</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/audioscribe-shimmer-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Audioscribe - Shimmer [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/AFmXC8I13yY\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/AFmXC8I13yY</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/TheLabyrinth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/TheLabyrinth</a></p>",

What do you say? How do you hold people’s attention?

Their attitude, outlook, and fighting spirit are unbelievably inspiring because this isn’t the first or biggest challenge they’ve had to face.</p> <p>As you’ll find out, they’ve been through worse. I’ll save this part of the story for the interview, but it’s one of the primary reasons why PaleoFX was created, and why we all believe that they will win this fight, and that the show will go on.</p> <p>With that being said, I have a favor to ask…</p> <p>Once you’re done listening to this interview, please jump on Twitter or Instagram, search for Michelle Norris, and send them your support through Twitter or Instagram. I know it would mean the world to them.</p> <p>With that being said, please welcome Michelle Norris</p> <h2>Resources:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://paleofx.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">PaleoFX.com</a> Follow PaleoFX on <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/paleofx/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/PaleoFX/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaleoFX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> Follow Michelle on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danamichellenorris/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/DMichelleNorris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href= \"https://twitter.com/dmichellenorris\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <h2>Music:</h2> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/domastic-memories-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domastic - Memories [NCS Release]</a> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.

Because if don’t, the pages are going to load much slower, and you’re not building your domain’s authority, reputation, or traffic by sending everyone to a page that’s hosted on the ClickFunnels domain.</p> <p>With that being said, I’ll bet there’s a very good chance you don’t know how to do that, because I don’t either.</p> <p>So what’s the solution?</p> <p>Well most people jump online and hire a web designer to make their webpages for them. But that’s when you run into the next big problem, because 99% of website designers don’t know how to design a website that’s built to convert visitors into leads and traffic.</p> <p>They want to build something that looks cool.</p> <p>You want a website that produces sales.</p> <p>So what do you do? How can you find someone who can design a beautiful page that converts, and that won’t break that bank in the process?</p> <p>Well you call up our guest today, Oliver Kenyon, who’s the founder of <a href=\"LandingPageGuys.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">LandingPageGuys.com.</a></p> <p>Oliver and his team are absolute wizards when it comes to building landing pages for online businesses of all types, and you’re about to receive an incredibly valuable breakdown of the components every page needs to turn visitors into leads, and leads into customers.</p> <p>They recently designed a new set of capture pages for MikeDillardMentoring, so I’d give them a ring if this is something you need help with.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://landingpagelab.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">LandingPageLab.com</a><br /> <a href=\"http://landingpageguys.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">LandingPageGuys.com</a>/p></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Track: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/more-plastic-champion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More Plastic - Champion [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/V4t33m70xLQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/V4t33m70xLQ</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/Champion\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/Cham</a></p>",

Too bad. You're not allowed to show them.</p> <p>If you write an article or blog post, or build a website about alternative health therapies, or unpopular opinions about the government, they take your organic traffic away and erase you from the internet.</p> <p>They're even manipulating and controlling our email inboxes now.

My way has been to intentionally ignore these differences, and to judge people based on their words and actions alone.</p> <p>So it was quite a light-bulb moment for me when I heard Teneshia’s story on how she’s built an incredibly successful business by directly acknowledging these differences, and creating marketing campaigns that intentionally speak to them.</p> <p>The bottom line is that you’re going to learn a lot today in an interview that I thoroughly enjoyed, and I believe you will as well.</p> <p>With that being said, please help me welcome, Teneshia Jackson Warner.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://thebigstretchbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">TheBigStretchBook.com</a><br /> <a href=\"https://egamigroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">EGAMI Group</a><br /> <a href=\"http://dreamprojectonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">The Dream Project</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Track: ROY - <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/roy-shining-radio-edit-wav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shining</a> [NCS Release]<br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/gKFyuuXwxBU\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/gKFyuuXwxBU</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/Shining\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/Shining</a>/p></p>",

But once you learn how to control and direct your thoughts, you will start to create the life you truly want.</p> <p>Forget marketing, forget social media, and business strategies.</p> <p>Yes, those things are important, but mastering your brain first is THE secret ensuring those efforts are effective.</p> <p>If you have read the books on Phil Knight of Nike, Steve Jobs, or Richard Branson, you know that all of them have one thing in common…</p> <p>Each of them credit their success in life to adopting a daily mental training practice. and today you’re going to learn how to do the same from our guest, John Assaraf.</p> <p>John is an incredible entrepreneur who’s built 5 multimillion dollar companies, written 2 New York Times Bestselling books and featured in 8 movies, including “The Secret” and “Quest For Success” with Richard Branson and the Dalai Lama.</p> <p>Today, he is the founder and CEO of NeuroGym, a company dedicated to using the most advanced technologies and evidence based brain training methods to help you unleash your fullest potential and maximize your results.</p> <p>I’ll just say this…</p> <p>Buy John’s book, use what you learn for the next 100 days, and you will absolutely change your life forever.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://ignitemybrain.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IgniteMyBrain.com</a><br /> <a href=\"http://neurogym.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">NeuroGym.com</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Having-All-Achieving-Lifes-Dreams/dp/141656361X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Having It All: Achieving Your Life's Goals and Dreams</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Track: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xoselfaus\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">XØ SELF</a> - <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/xo-self-dr3ams-ft-arzencs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dR3ÄMS</a> (ft.

And if you want to learn how to get paid to speak from stages around the world, then Pete is your guy.</p> <p>And just to clarify, when Pete and I talk about speaking from stage, that includes speaking from an actual stage with a live audience, as well as speaking on a podcast, or a webinar.</p> <p>Well after he finished sharing a few stories with me about his work and what his clients have accomplished, I realized that I have been missing out on a massive, massive opportunity to make an impact, and grow my business.</p> <p>I’ve always known there were opportunities when it came to speaking, but I had no idea how big those opportunities were.</p> <p>In fact, a month later I flew out to Wisconsin and spent two days learning how to craft the perfect talk from Pete and his team, and it was just an incredible experience.</p> <p>Now personally, here’s why I’m making stages a huge priority for my business next year…</p> <p>It’s the best possible way to make an impact and build rapport with an audience.</p> <p>There’s no competition… You have a captive audience who’s there to hear your message, and if you decide to make an offer at the end of your talk, people tend to buy.</p> <p>And finally, it’s a consistent way to acquire new customers without having to worry about Facebook or Google’s algorithm.</p> <p>Stages have always been around, and will continue to be around no matter what happens on the tech side.</p> <p>Thankfully Pete was recently back in Austin for another business visit, so I invited him over the house to record this amazing interview so he can share his wisdom with you.</p> <p>Next year I’m going to start speaking from all kinds of stages, both real and virtual, and I think you’re going to want to do the same by the time you finish this incredible interview with Pete Vargas.</p> <p>You can also download his free training materials at <a href= \"http://www.MikeDillard.com/stages\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://www.MikeDillard.com/stages</a></p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://mikedillard.com/stages\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Why Stages Workshop</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Track: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/modernrevolt\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modern Revolt</a> - <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/modern-revolt-volt-ncs-r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VOLT</a> [NCS Release] Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.

It’s basically a little crack addict that constantly needs another hit of that chemical, and before you know it, you’re on Amazon once again, and hitting the buy button.</p> <p>Once you’re aware of why your brain does this, you can start to short-circuit and reprogram this pattern, which is the key to making better decisions in every area of your life.</p> <p>This is one of those episodes that can have a dramatic impact on your life moving forward to get ready to take some notes, and please help me welcome Adam Lyons.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://psychologyhacker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">PsychologyHacker.com</a><br /> Follow Psychology Hacker on <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/PsychologyHacker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/user/AFCAdamLondon\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">YouTube</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Hacking-Rewire-Your-Mind/dp/1987526996\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brain Hacking: Rewire Your Mind to Have It All</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Track: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/IamMynerva\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mynerva</a> & <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/NytrixMusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Nytrix</a> - <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/mynerva-nytrix-find-you-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find You [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Watch: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/nJWkpMw4aug\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtu.be/nJWkpMw4aug</a><br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/FindYou\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/FindYou</a></p> <p>How To Permanently Stop Self-Sabotage...</p>",

Within the next few years, I found myself having to sue two different people for the first time in my life.</p> <p>Unfortunately, both of them had mental health problems. Their actions were unreasonable, their motives were to intentionally cause myself and my business harm, and they had no desire to find an actual remedy to the situation.</p> <p>They were not healthy people. They wanted conflict and that was their goal.</p> <p>So I called up some of my older and wiser mentors at the time, and they all said the same thing… Don’t pursue a lawsuit unless you absolutely must, but if you must, then go all in.</p> <p>So that’s what I did… It took almost a year in one case, and several years in the next, but I eventually won both cases.</p> <p>So why am I bringing all of this up?</p> <p>Because my goal of going through life without ever getting involved in a lawsuit, while putting myself in front of millions of people was naive.</p> <p>As someone who conducts business with other people and companies, you are going to run into conflict, and you are going to run into mentally unstable people no matter how well you run your business.</p> <p>It is an unfortunate part of life, so my goal today is to simply prepare you for that day which can be one of the most difficult experiences you’ll ever have.</p> <p>To help me do that, we’re joined by the attorney who helped me handle those cases, Mr. Peter Hoppenfeld.</p> <p>Today Peter’s going to make sure you have your legal basics in place and covered, and to give you some sound advice when it comes to doing business in a litigious world.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://peterhoppenfeld.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">PeterHoppenfeld.com</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Track: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/djdomastic\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domastic</a> & <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/annayvette\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Anna Yvette</a> - <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/domastic-anna-yvette-echoes-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Echoes [NCS Release]</a><br /> Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br /> Free Download / Stream: <a href=\"http://ncs.io/EchoesD\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ncs.io/EchoesD</a></p> <p> </p>",

While I’m still not sleeping normally just yet, my brain is back online. I can think, I can speak, and my energy levels have started to return.</p> <p>And I’ll just say this… The culprit was shocking. This whole mess was caused by a household toxin that’s in your home right now. It’s something that you’re breathing every day, and whether or not it affects you is simply a matter of your level of exposure.</p> <p>If you have any friends or family members with a chronic or undiagnosed illness, they could definitely be suffering from the same thing, so please share this with them so they can get tested asap.</p> <p>Now during the past year, I’ve always said that when I’m ready to tell this story, I wanted to do it around a table with the people who helped me through it, which is exactly what we did.</p> <p>So today I’m joined by my friend Aubrey Marcus who hosted this interview, along with Krisstina Wise, and my physician, Dr. Ann Shippy. We held this group discussion at Aubrey’s office, and you can watch the entire interview on video at MikeDillard.com/heal</p> <p>While this situation has been the single biggest challenge of my life, it has also been the most rewarding because of the personal work and transformation that it forced me to do, including all kinds of psychedelic medicine which we’ll be talking about today.</p> <p>This is one hell of a story, and this is definitely the most personal interview I’ve ever given, so thank you for your support during this past year, and I’m incredibly grateful that I’m back to work so I can help you guys and serve you in any way that I can.</p> <p>Without further ado, let’s dive in…</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://annshippymd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">AnnShippyMD.com</a><br /> <a href=\"http://choosemuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">ChooseMuse.com</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Curable-Unlikely-Radical-Innovators-Transform/dp/1603589260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curable: How an Unlikely Group of Radical Innovators is Trying to Transform our Health Care System</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Music by: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ascenceprod\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ascence</a><br /> Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/ascence-about-youmaster-wav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">About You</a><br /> Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Creative Commons License</a></p> <p> </p>",

In fact, you are very likely surrounded by the toxin that made me sick right now as you listen to this.</p> <p>My friend Aubrey Marcus will be hosting the interview, and we’ll be joined by my doctor as well, as I publically fill you in on the most challenging, and rewarding adventures of my life for the very first time.</p> <p>Now without further ado, please welcome Dr. Jason Wersland.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://theragun.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Theragun.com</a><br /> Follow Dr. Jason on <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/drjasonwersland/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a><br /> Follow Theragun on <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/theragun/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgA-nI5zzB38T_OsRK9030A\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Music by: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/BeatcoreOfficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beatcore</a> & <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/AshleyApollodor\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Ashley Apollodor</a><br /> Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/beatcore-ashley-apollodor-burning-bridges-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Burning Bridges</a><br /> Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Creative Commons License</a></p> <p> </p>",

            "description": "<p>Well gang, I have some pretty big news for you…</p> <p>About two months ago, we finally figured out what caused my brain injury last June, and it was something completely unexpected.</p> <p>Now we’re going to save that entire story for its own dedicated episode where my doctor will be joining me as a guest to break down everything that happened, and how I’m recovering from it, but in the meantime, I get to share one of the most valuable healers that I’ve had a chance to work with over the past year.</p> <p>When the injury first occurred, I had no idea what had happened, or what caused it. I thought it must have been stress-related, and that 15 years of business stress, caffeine, and adrenaline just burned out my nervous system.</p> <p>So I pursued any and every kind of therapy that I could that addressed that part of the body and mind, and one of those therapies was hypnosis.</p> <p>A few friends of mine recommended that I reach out to our guest today. His name is Elliot Roe, and he is one of the most well-respected hypnotherapists in the world.</p> <p>His clients include Olympic athletes, UFC fighters, professional poker players, some of the most successful entrepreneurs you can think of, behind billion-dollar companies.</p> <p>Now I had never been hypnotized in my life, and frankly, I thought it was kind of hokey, but I was desperate and willing to try absolutely anything that might help.</p> <p>So I signed on with Elliot as a client and holy smokes…</p> <p>This stuff absolutely works.</p> <p>At the end of the day, our outside world and the life that we’ve built for ourselves is a reflection of the subconscious programming we’ve internalized.</p> <p>All of us have baggage from our lives that create subconscious thoughts and stories, that affect our decisions from that point forward. And the really crappy part is that you’re not even aware that these stories exist. They are invisible to your conscious mind, which makes them incredibly hard to identify and then change.</p> <p>Well, hypnosis is the solution to that problem. It’s one of the few ways that we can tap into our subconscious programming, identify thoughts and stories that are holding us back, and then rewrite them.</p> <p>Going through this process has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and I’m truly excited that I get to introduce you guys to Elliot, and to this technology today.</p> <p>If you’re ready to give your brain and your inner programming a major upgrade, this is an incredibly effective way to do it.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://mikedillard.com/elliot\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Primed Mind App</a><br /> <a href=\"http://elliotroe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">ElliotRoe.com</a><br /> <a href=\"https://agameadvantage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">The A-Game Advantage Podcast</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Music by: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/PatrickReza\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrick Reza</a><br /> Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/patrick-reza-choices-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Choices</a><br /> Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Creative Commons License</a></p> <p> </p>",

He dreaded going to work every day, so he finally decided that enough was enough. He quit his job and dedicated his life to learning about personal growth, productivity, spirituality, and fulfillment.</p> <p>What he learned would eventually find its way into a book that he self-published and printed at Kinkos called, “The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari”.</p> <p>15 million copies later, Robin has become one of the most successful and respected authors in the world.</p> <p>At the heart of his success, is his morning routine which he’ll share with you today here in detail.</p> <p>Whether you subscribe to Hal’s approach, or Aubrey’s, or Robin’s, one thing is certain…</p> <p>If you want to change your life, the very first step you take every single morning is the single most important part of the process.</p> <p>If you master your morning, you’ll win the day.

            "datePublished": "Wed, 26 Jun 2019 16:48:38 +0000",
            "description": "<p>So if you’ve been getting my emails this week, you know that I’m extremely excited that my friend Teeka Tiwari has spent the last year traveling around the world to find out the best way to invest in the cannabis revolution that’s taking place in the US right now.</p> <p>If you’ve been listening to the show for a while, you know that this is a topic I’m extremely interested in. We’ve interviewed the founder of Green Man Cannabis, Christian Hagaseth, and Dr. Mike Hart, who’s been on Joe Rogan’s show, and who is one of the biggest advocates in the world for the medicinal benefits that cannabis can provide.</p> <p>Right now, outside of crypto, cannabis is the single best investment opportunity of our lives, but figuring out the best way to invest in the industry, isn’t very clear at all.</p> <p>Should you invest in the farms that are growing the plants?</p> <p>Should you invest in the processing and manufacturing facilities?</p> <p>Should you invest in the consumer brands like Dan Bilzarian’s Ignite?</p> <p>Should you invest in a Cannabis stock fund, or ETF?</p> <p>The options are endless, and just like crypto, you can make life-changing money, but there is also a significant amount of risk involved.</p> <p>The good news, is that you can dramatically reduce that level of risk when you arm yourself with research and information, which is exactly what Teeka has done.</p> <p>He’s found the greatest point of leverage in this new industry, and in my humble opinion, you’d be foolish not to invest a small amount of money in this industry right now.</p> <p>So I asked him to jump on the phone today for this quick interview to help us navigate the industry, and to share what he’s learned.</p> <p>Now tonight, June 26th, he will be holding a live webinar sharing what they’ve discovered in detail, and while I can’t say exactly what it is publicly before he does, I can tell you this…</p> <p>You’re going to have the opportunity to participate in some private-placement opportunities alongside myself and the rest of his team, in the Cannabis industry. The time he invested in one of these, he turned $1,000, into $1.6 million.</p> <p>So if this is an area of interest for you, as it is for me, make sure you head to PalmBeachGoesGreen.com to register for tonight’s webinar.</p> <p>I do know that these opportunities are definitely limited in nature, so you’re going to want to be at the front of the line for what they’re going to share.</p> <p>Again, you can register to attend tonight’s live webinar at www.PalmBeachGoesGreen.com. If you need to pause the recording and pull up your browser, do that right now, and then we’ll dive into this extremely interesting interview with Teeka.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://palmbeachgoesgreen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">PalmBeachGoesGreen.com</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Music by: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/rudelies\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RudeLies</a> & <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/facadingmusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facading</a><br /> Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/rudelies-facading-arabian-nights-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arabian Nights</a><br /> Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Creative Commons License</a></p> <p> </p>",

On one hand, they can be incredibly convenient if you find yourself in a bustling city center filled with traffic. And on the other hand, they can be an unsightly nuisance as people take to the streets and sidewalks at 20 mph on a device they can barely control.</p> <p>But one thing is for sure… It’s an urban transportation revolution with billions of dollars at stake, and today Euwyn will take us behind the scenes and onto the front-lines of the scooter wars in a level of detail you’ve never heard before.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p>Download <a href=\"http://spin.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Spin.app</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Music by: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/aedenofficial\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aeden</a> & <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/HarleyBird\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Harley Bird</a><br /> Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/aeden-harley-bird-find-a-way-out-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find a Way Out</a><br /> Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Creative Commons License</a></p> <p> </p>",

They were all in a place of anger, frustration, and suffering, and all of them eventually found a way to stop their downward spiral, make a change, and as a result, they are all spectacularly successful by any measure, as a result today.</p> <p>Having had the opportunity to hear about each of their transformations in detail through this show, I’ve noticed that all of them have 3 things in common…</p> <p>1: A breaking point and a moment of decision where they said, enough is enough.</p> <p>2: A deliberate and obsessive search for new knowledge, tools, and people that could help facilitate the changes they wished to make.</p> <p>3: And finally, an unwavering commitment to the process, combined with patience. There was never a timeline or a deadline.

We’ll I can tell you from experience that, that’s rarely the case, even though it might feel like a similar activity.</p> <p>So what can you do to ensure that you don’t take unnecessary risks, and that you are setting yourself up to achieve your true goal, which is financial freedom?</p> <p>Well the first is to become aware of this trap, and the second is to invest your money in ways that will protect and grow it conservatively.</p> <p>Right now we’re overdue for a stock market crash. We’re in the middle of the longest bull run in history, and we’re hitting new all-time highs, which means one thing… A crash is on the way. It might take place in a few months, or in a few years, but every single day that goes by, brings it one step closer.</p> <p>The good news is that right now you have a chance to do something about, and to protect your wealth which is exactly what my guest Patrick and I are going to teach you how to do.</p> <p>This one single investment strategy has the power to completely change your life, so pay attention, take notes, and please help me welcome, Patrick Donohoe.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <p><a href=\"http://headsortailsiwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">HeadsOrTailsIWin.com</a><br /> <a href= \"https://mikedillard.com/class/how-to-build-wealth-with-infinite-banking-with-patrick-donohoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch Patrick's Class - How To Build Your Wealth With Infinite Banking</a><br /> <a href= \"https://mikedillard.com/episodes/how-ordinary-men-can-build-extraordinary-wealth-with-these-simple-strategies-with-mark-ford/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Listen to Mark Ford on the Mike Dillard Podcast</a></p> <h3>Music:</h3> <p>Music by: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lostskydiary\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lost Sky</a><br /> Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/lost-sky-vision-ncs-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vision</a><br /> Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Creative Commons License</a></p> <p> </p>",

            "description": "<p>Today’s episode is one of the most important we’ve ever produced on this show, because it acknowledges several huge financial traps that most entrepreneurs will certainly face.</p> <p>We’re joined my Mike Michalowicz, who’s the author of one of the most important books that I’ve ever read, “Profit First”.</p> <p>Now there are two primary traps that we’re going to discuss today…</p> <p>The first is a vicious cycle that many entrepreneurs will experience, and that’s the cycle of paying yourself last as the business owner.</p> <p>99% of the time, if you have expenses that need to be covered to keep your business operating, you’re going to pay those expenses first, even that doesn’t leave enough money for you personally.</p> <p>This increases stress tremendously, and it constantly puts you in a short-term reactive state of emergency, instead of a proactive state of steady, stable growth that reduces your stress, and allows you to make better, long-term decisions.</p> <p>The second trap that we’re going to run into, has to do with the way you manage your company’s finances.</p> <p>If you’re a small business with less than 10 employees, there’s a very good chance that you run your business by simply looking at the current balance of your checking account.</p> <p>If there’s money in the account, great! You’ll find a place to spend or invest it until it’s gone, and you’re back a square one again.</p> <p>I can’t tell you how common these traps are. Ryan Deiss shared the fact that he went through these same patterns until he found Mike’s book. I’ve gone through them as well, and so has Mike.</p> <p>If you’ll take a few days to implement Mike’s system in Profit First, I firmly believe that it will completely change your financial life, and your relationship with money.</p> <p>Your profits will increase, your stress will decrease, and you’ll build a more stable and successful business.</p> <p>So please help me welcome Mike.</p> <h3>Resources: </h3> <ul> <li><a href= \"http://mikemichalowicz.com/\">MikeMichalowicz.com</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://profitfirstprofessionals.com/\">ProfitFirstProfessionals.com</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Transform-Business-Cash-Eating-Monster-Money-Making/dp/0981808298\"> Profit First: A Simple System to Transform Your Business from a Cash-Eating Monster to a Money-Making Machine</a> </li> </ul> <h3>Music:</h3> <ul> <li>Music by: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/iamomri\">Omri</a></li> <li>Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/omri-dishonest-ncs-release\">Dis\\Honest</a></li> <li>Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></li> </ul>",

            "description": "<p>Today’s podcast is going to be incredibly valuable if you’re looking for the fastest and easiest way to build a 6-figure business that can replace your income, and then allow you to scale to 7-figures.</p> <p>At the end of the day, making money is all about math.</p> <p>If you want to make $20,000 per month selling a $40 Ebook, you’d have to acquire 500 new customers per month, and the only way you’re going to be able to do that, is by putting 80-90% of the that money back into advertising.</p> <p>So yes, you might make $20,000 in revenue, but you’d be lucky if any of that was actually left over as profit.</p> <p>Or you can take a second option which is a bit counter-intuitive...</p> <p>Instead of selling a simple e-book, you could sell access to a group coaching program for around $3,000 to $5,000. This means you’d only need to find just one new customer per week.</p> <p>Finding four high-end customers per month is actually much easier, and much more profitable than finding 500.</p> <p>So if you have some specialized knowledge or a skill set that can really solve someone’s problem or that can help them achieve a desired result, this is a business model that I would highly recommend taking a very close look at, and to help you learn more about it today, we’re joined by Russ Ruffino.</p> <p>Russ is the founder of Clients On Demand, and over the past few years he’s helped thousands of experts create an incredibly simple consulting business that has allowed them to quickly replace or exceed their traditional income.</p> <p>I learned about Russ a few months ago because my friend Krisstina is one of his clients, and had great feedback about his company, and their services.</p> <p>What I found is a team that truly cares about the success of their customers, and who is willing to guide them through the process of setting up a consulting business, every single step of the way.</p> <p>This could be a life-changing opportunity for many of you, so get ready to take some notes, and please help me welcome, Russ Ruffino.</p> <h3>Resources:</h3> <ul> <li>Book a call with Russ at <a href= \"http://codcall.com/\">CODCall.com</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">TrustPilot</a> </li> </ul> <h3>Music:</h3> <ul> <li>Music by: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/djniviro\">NIVIRO</a></li> <li>Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/niviro-get-my-love-ncs-release\">Get My Love</a></li> <li>Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></li> </ul>",

            "description": "<p>Today we have the incredible opportunity to talk to the Billionaire Founder of Activision and Blizzard games, Howard Marks.</p> <p>Howard purchased Activision games way back in 1991, and has grown it into the multi-billion dollar publishing company behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.</p> <p>Today, he is also diving headfirst into the crypto industry through his latest company, <a href= \"http://startengine.com/\">StartEngine.com</a></p> <p>StartEngine is an equity-based crowdfunding platform that allows entrepreneurs to raise money through the crowd, by offering real equity in their business.</p> <p>Today, Howard and Startengine are also on the cutting edge when it comes to crypto-assets, and it’s one of the first platforms in the world that’s helping entrepreneurs launch STO’s which stand for Security Token Offerings.</p> <p>These are legally compliant security tokens that represent real ownership and equity in a crypto company.</p> <p>As I’ve mentioned before, security tokens will be one of the biggest ways that crypto will change the world because they’ll allow us to tokenize any business, instead of just that can afford to go public.</p> <p>But what I loved most about this interview, was the chance to talk to Howard about the changes that crypto will bring to the gaming industry.</p> <p>As you’ll hear, we’ve both seen the writing on the wall, and that digital objects of value secured on the blockchain, will completely revolutionize the gaming industry in the years to come.</p> <p>This is an absolutely incredibly opportunity to learn about this new industry from one of the leaders in the space.</p> <p>With that being said, I would encourage you to consider putting a small amount of money into the crypto market now, and in the weeks and months to come.</p> <p>As of today, the market is down 80% from it’s all time high a year ago, so if you want to buy low and sell high, now is the time to start building your positions in these assets.</p> <p>If you need help learning how to do that, head over to <a href= \"http://selfmademan.com/crypto\">www.SelfMadeMan.com/crypto</a> today.</p> <p>I’ve put together a brand new Master Class that will teach you everything you need to know to buy and safely store crypto, and the best part, is that I’m going to give you access to my personal portfolio as a free bonus.</p> <p>If you don’t know where to start, or which assets to invest in, my portfolio will save you a ton of time and research.</p> <p>So head to <a href= \"http://selfmademan.com/crypto\">SelfMadeMan.com/crypto</a> now to learn more, and please note that registration for this Master Class will close this Thursday night, on January 10th.</p> <h3>Resources: </h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://startengine.com/\">StartEngine</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://selfmademan.com/crypto\">SelfMadeMan.com/Crypto</a></li> </ul> <h3>Music:</h3> <ul> <li>Music by: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/djniviro\">NIVIRO</a></li> <li>Song: <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/niviro-diamond-ncs-release\">Diamond</a></li> <li>Licensed under a <a href= \"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></li> </ul>",

            "description": "<p>I love success stories like the one you’re about to hear today, because these are the dreams that entrepreneurship is made of.</p> <p>Mike Salguero had a simple problem… His wife was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, and their doctor’s were unanimous… You must eat clean, grass fed beef that’s free or hormones antibiotics, and that are never fed grain.</p> <p>But as they soon found out, finding pure grass-fed beef was nearly impossible.</p> <p>Now if you’re like me, this is where you say, “wait a minute Mike, why don’t they just to Whole Foods. They sell grass-fed beef?”</p> <p>Well as I learned in this interview that’s not exactly true. In fact, less than 1% of beef consumed in the US, is truly grass fed.</p> <p>And that’s when they realized that sourcing the cleanest, purest sources of animal meat, is actually a really big challenge.</p> <p>So they started with a single cow they found on a farm, and shared it with friends.</p> <p>And then one of them asked if he could just have this quality of meat delivered straight to his house, and that was it.</p> <p>That was the spark that inspired Mike to start Butcher Box… A company that sources and ships the pursest, healthiest meat you can get, straight to your door.</p> <p>And what I love most about this story, is that Mike had never been in the meat business. He didn’t know how to have it processed, or packaged, or shipped.</p> <p>He had to figure all of that out from scratch, and he even managed to do it without any kind of outside funding.</p> <p>So today we’re going to dive into the story of ButcherBox, and how Mike has now scaled it to an incredibly fast growing, multi-million dollar company.</p> <p>Make sure you listen to the end where he shares one of the single pieces of the puzzle, which happened to be one very specific person that he hired, and if you’d like to try ButcherBox for yourself, he has graciously offered a $25 discount off your first order.
