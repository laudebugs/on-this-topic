Ignore it, it isn’t important.&nbsp;The debate is more energy than it is worth.\r\n\r\nFollow widely unfollow freelyIf you are a teacher, follow teachers. If you are running a classroom account, follow classroom accounts. Unfollow at the first sign of trouble. Never feel guilty about unfollowing. Don’t show your students the raw feed unless you have a good reason.\r\n\r\nExpect your kids and parents to read your feed They won’t read all your posts, but they will see every mistake you make. Make the right ones.\r\n\r\nLift up someone else’s workShare the work of the teachers and classrooms you follow. This is an easy way to stay active and share positive.\r\n\r\nAsk questions If you see a project you like, ask a question. People love to answer questions about what they shared. Everybody learns from good questions.\r\n\r\nChats aren’t required People can get really excited about Twitter chats, you don’t have to. They can be overwhelming and they are not for everyone.\r\n\r\nTurn notifications off Seriously, evil corporations are reshaping your brain’s chemistry through notifications. I am not kidding, turn that crap off.\r\n\r\nUse threads to tie together a group of examples Post a “Title tweet” that has the name of the assignment and then “thread” the rest of the examples as replies.\r\n\r\nInteract with those who feed your practice. If you find someone’s tweet useful or inspiring, tell them. Don’t just RT it, say “thanks” it matters.\r\n\r\nNever forget these platforms were built to monetize outrage and disagreement, don’t make money for them.\r\n\r\nWe left 3 important points off of this list. . . . .

Saves the back and forth time in emails.\r\n\r\nUse  Remind  (https://www.remind.com/) for quick contact.\r\n\r\nTip 3 – Keep Track of Events and DocumentsEvernote: It’s the perfect application to save documents, audio, PDF’s and it’s available on all platforms.\r\n\r\nTip 4 – Digital Communication and OrganizationUtilize Google Docs/Folders to record conversations and coaching sessions for future conversations. \r\n\r\nTip 5 – Provide Resources for Personalized LearningKeep ongoing blog as a one-stop-shop for all your teachers’ needs. Update with things you often come across for them to go back to. Also helps alleviate email you send to staff.\r\n\r\nTip 6 – Create Personalized Videos Jing (https://www.techsmith.com/jing-tool.html)  – a great quick screen recording tool for simple how-to videos.\r\n\r\nTip 7 – Create a Data DashboardRecord important events right after they happen.&nbsp;It’s easy to go an entire day and forget to record important events or meetings with teachers. Use a Google Doc, Evernote, Google Keep, or Google Form to keep track of what you have done each day.&nbsp;Use it to create a Data Dashboard of your events. You never know when it might come in handy.\r\n\r\nTip 8 – Create User Groups for Group Instruction Facebook groups (https://www.gcflearnfree.org/facebook101/facebook-groups/1/)  – create hubs for people to share resources. It’s not just me that may have the answer. \r\n\r\nTip 9 – Create an Army of Foot SoldiersUtilize your most willing teachers to assist in training/sparking innovation in others. If you build it, they will come.\r\n\r\nTip 10 – When in Need… Wear it! Make an Apron  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wno-rfZg_j0) &nbsp;Aprons- You could rock an apron and save hundreds on clothes and instantly have more pockets!

Jarod’s book lays out the WHY behind such a shift is needed and also offers the Professionally Driven model as the HOW. It started with one school in rural Iowa and has begun to spread to schools all over the midwest and beyond. Pick up this book to begin empowering EVERY educator, because professional development shouldn’t create master teachers. It should create master learners\r\n\r\nJoin the ConversationOur favorite part of recording a live podcast each week is participating in the great conversations that happen on our live chat, on social media, and in our comments section.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis weeks question is:\r\n\r\nWhat are your productivity tips and tricks?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease leave us a...",

Add documents, insert links, tag people for “to do” items, and link notes to Outlook meetings.\r\n\r\nTravel Light with OneNoteKeep all your travel arrangements in OneNote (airline, hotel, rental car), print important emails &amp; flyers with information about where you are going into OneNote, and use Office Lens to insert PDFs of your receipts (if you are lucky enough to be reimbursed). Any presentations you are sharing (PPT, Sway or other) can also be stored on OneNote, just in case! Then use OneNote on your smartphone when you travel to stay super organized and travel light\r\n\r\nOrganize your PodcastingMicrosoft OneNote can be used to help organize all of your podcast needs. Simply use its infinite canvas to gather your thoughts on show topics, create show notes, and store your audio/video.\r\n\r\nJoin us for this year's Conference!The Learn OneNote Conference is an online event happening November 7th through November 13th that will gather more than 25 OneNote experts to share their best tips, tricks, and hacks for OneNote. Both business productivity topics and education topics will be included with speakers sharing their screens to show exactly how and what they accomplish with OneNote.

            "description": "\r\n\r\nIn this episode of the  TechEducator Podcast (https://www.teachercast.net/tep) , we discuss how any teacher, no matter what subject or grade level can bring robotics into their curriculum.&nbsp;Our guests tonight are from Microbric, the creators of the Edison Robots and from Sphero, the creators of the Sphero and BB-8 Robot.\r\n\r\nTopics DiscussedRobots make abstract concepts concrete\r\n\r\nRobots outside of STEM classes\r\n\r\nThe power of multiple robots\r\n\r\nAbout Sphero  (https://www.teachercast.net/product/B06ZZGWG85/US/teach00-20/?cart=y) Sphero began the connected play revolution in 2010 by creating something unlike anything – and we never stopped. We fuse robotic and digital technology into immersive entertainment experiences that ignite imagination and defy expectation. Optimized by data and powered by fun, these ever-evolving experiences are changing the way the world thinks about play.\r\n\r\nLinks of Interest Twitter (https://twitter.com/Sphero) \r\n\r\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GoSphero) \r\n\r\nYouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/gosphero) \r\n\r\nStore (https://www.teachercast.net/product/B01GZ1S7OS/US/teach00-20/?cart=y) \r\n\r\nAbout Edison Robots  (https://www.teachercast.net/product/B01HSFMK6G/US/teach00-20/?cart=y) In 2014, with only a tiny team based in South Australia, Microbric launched the Edison robot with a bang. The wildly successful Kickstarter campaign hit 524% funding and the popularity of Edison has only grown from there. The highly versatile and easy-to-use robot is now distributed globally and can be found in schools in more than 50 countries around the world.\r\n\r\nMicrobric’s vision for the Edison robot is to create an affordable, comprehensive STEM teaching resource for coding and robotics education for students in years 3 – 9. To support this vision, users of Edison have access to free educational resources and programming apps.\r\n\r\nThe Edison robot can be programmed multiple ways: using pre-set barcodes, EdWare, EdPy and now, EdBlocks.\r\n\r\nEdBlocks, the newest programming language for Edison robots, is a fully icon-based language that is super easy to use. A drag-and-drop block-based system, EdBlocks is intuitive and fun, even for younger users. Perfect for introducing anyone to programming, EdBlocks is ideal for students aged 8 to 12 years old.\r\n\r\nStudents can then take their programming further with EdWare, a hybrid graphical language, and EdPy, a highly versatile text-based programming language based on Python.\r\n\r\nBest of all? Access to all programming languages and associated teaching resources is absolutely free.\r\n\r\nLearn more at www.meetedison.com\r\n\r\nLinks of Interest Homepage (http://www.meetedison.com) \r\n\r\nEdBlocks (https://meetedison.com/robot-programming-software/edblocks/) \r\n\r\nEdBlocks App (http://www.edblocksapp.com) \r\n\r\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/meetedison) \r\n\r\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/MeetEdison) \r\n\r\nPinterest (https://au.pinterest.com/meetedison/) \r\n\r\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/meet_edison/) \r\n\r\nYouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/microbric) \r\n\r\nThank You For Your Podcast ReviewsAre you enjoying  commenting on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/educational-podcasting-today/id972444781?mt=2)  today?

Her degree in psychology and education from Emory University, along with her training and experience as a Montessori teacher, power her passion for wide-scale education improvement. It is this passion that led her to start her company&nbsp; Crescerance (http://crescerance.com/) &nbsp;(cris-seer-unce) in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn Crescerance’s short lifespan of just over 3 years,&nbsp;Alefiya&nbsp;has enabled over 150 educational institutions in America and throughout the world to better communicate with and engage their communities through the growing power of mobile.&nbsp;Alefiya&nbsp;is passionate about making mobile an easily available and powerful channel to thousands of schools worldwide. She is now focussing on bringing the concepts and tools of app development to students as young as the 3rd grade by enabling them to build mobile apps with the newly launched&nbsp; MAD-learn (http://mad-learn.com/) &nbsp;program. In her spare time, she enjoys touring the world, meeting new people, learning new languages, and experiencing new cultures. She is also a closet adrenaline junkie who loves the occasional sky or sea dive expedition.\r\n\r\nAbout CresceranceCrescerance began its journey in 2011 with the simple idea of wanting to make it easier for schools to connect and truly engage with their parents, staff, students, alumni, and community at large. Through working with schools in creating their school apps (so that everyone could be connected through Mobile and have quick, easy access to the information they needed), we met students that had a keen interest in not just using the app that we created for their school, but in wanting to learn about the creation process of that app.\r\n\r\n“How did you make our app?” was a question that we got asked through numerous in person or Skype calls from teachers wanting to bring an App Developer perspective to their students. This is where MAD-learn was born. It was born from the curiosity of our students. From their quest to know more and absorb more. From our passion to feed that curiosity.\r\n\r\nMAD stands for Mobile App Development and MAD-learn is a program that is teaching students how to be Creators of Technology, instead of just Consumers of it. To learn more about MAD-learn, watch this video:&nbsp; MAD-learn.com (http://mad-learn.com/) \r\n\r\nHour of Code&nbsp;Interested in getting your kids coding? Http://Code.org/learn has resources to get any teacher, even one with no available tech, rolling for the hour of code.\r\n\r\nYou can even use the Hour of Code as an opportunity to build community at your school by hosting and Hour of Code family coding event. Here is a great place to get started.&nbsp;http://www.edutopia.org/blog/family-coding-day-hour-of-code-sam-patterson\r\n\r\n",
