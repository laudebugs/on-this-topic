This path is not always obvious or easy to walk down. In many cases, it takes a heinous, frightful, unbelievable event to show us the true nature of the dark that lives in and out of the human experience. When we are forced down this path, forced to look in the mirror, forced to ask the hard questions, we will have officially entered the innermost cave on the Hero’s Journey. On this heroic journey, we will need allies and support networks, some solid feet on the ground, and a sense of faith. And of course, Astrology can be beneficial on this path.  \n\nJupiter is currently living and breathing in the underworld of Scorpio. He is illuminating the darkness in our individual lives and in the collective. His current trine to Neptune in Pisces heightens this energy and the Full Moon in Pisces on the 26th might be a real ass kicker! Right now, we are being forced to not only look at the dark but also look to how we try to escape it through denial, addiction, and false worship. We are being faced with our delusions about others and ourselves, which have denied us from seeing important truths. Turns out, evil DOES exist. It is naïve to try and deny this through positive thinking, rose-colored spectacles or rejection of gut feelings. \n\nWhere do these demons come from? How can humans be so sinister and evil to one another? The definition of evil to me is the individual who rejects their shadow and instead lets it grow. In worse cases, into a monster. Right now, there is a battle cry from the Gods and Goddesses above. They scream: “LOOK! Don’t turn away!”\n\nIt is painful, it is scary, it is intense, it is IMPORTANT!\n\nIn this week’s podcast, I will be discussing the importance of looking deeply in the mirror and accepting truths about the nature of ourselves and humanity. Accepting that not everyone comes to us with good intentions and how to trust when you’ve encountered true darkness inside and outside. I will also discuss the necessity of support and tribe during these times.\n\nTo support this work and get even more info ‘bout this shit, join the TRIBE at patron.com/bridgingrealities",
