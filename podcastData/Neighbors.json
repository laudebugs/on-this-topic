            "description": "\r\n        <p><strong>In the historic city of Magdeburg, Germany, there is a “Johnny Cash”-themed country music festival called Nashville Days – complete with corn dogs and cowboy hats. This is one of the fruits of the sister city relationship between Nashville and Magdeburg. Host Jakob Lewis, a Nashville citizen, goes to Magdeburg to see where the rubber meets the road for Sister Cities' idealistic vision to “promote peace one individual, one community at a time.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you’ve been to Germany, Magdeburg probably isn’t the first city that comes to mind when you to think of cosmopolitan cities. Yet for the past 15 years, Magdeburg has developed a great relationship with its sister city Nashville through the Sister Cities International program. For The Big Pond, Jakob Lewis traces the origins of the sister cities back to the aftermath of World War II as a means to (re)connect former adversaries.<br>\n<br>\nOr, as Joel Dark, the Nashville chair of the Nashville-Magdeburg partnership puts it: “The concept is to build a local-to-local relationship so that international relations [are] not reduced to just relationships between governments and their agendas but can be a relationship really between people.” At a time when the US’ general tone for diplomacy has shifted, what does Sister Cities’ idealistic vision of peace really look like? Does it actually make a difference? Is it just a glorified trip club where well-to-do folks can drink wine in another country? Or is it the key to world peace? Listen to find out more.</p>\n\n<p>This story was produced in 2018 as part of the The Big Pond series with the Goethe-Institut, and the Year of German American Friendship 2018/2019 under the motto “Wunderbar Together”. Special thanks to Rosie Forrest for editing this story.

As a Muslim teen from Iraq, Fatimah is learning to navigate that typical experience: striking the balance between fitting in and being your own person. In her senior year at Harrisonburg High, Fatimah decided to try out for the school play, which pushed her boundaries around sexuality and acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>Harrisonburg, Virginia is unique as well: there are 51 countries and 57 languages represented in Harrisonburg’s public schools. Not every refugee teen experience is a positive one, but the overwhelming support and pride that the Harrisonburg community takes in its immigrants and refugees means that leaders prioritize their needs in a way that the federal government is not.</p>\n\n<p>Resettled is hosted by Ahmed Badr.

These particular heroes are middle schoolers, playing a tabletop roll-playing game at a Nashville community center. The game master is Josh Unruh. He's also a barista and leather worker. A couple years ago, Josh was sinking into despair over our polarizing political climate. Rather than give into the hostility, he decided he would “follow his bliss”. As a lifelong enjoyer of role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, Josh decided to share the benefits of those games with kids and founded an afterschool program to teach them a new game he and his friend Keith created for that purpose: The Heroes’ Guild RPG. It incentivizes peacemaking and cooperation over fighting, and you get a front row seat at how four kids embody the game.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThanks for listening all these years! You’re the best!

Your heart might skip a beat when you see Robert Plant, Jack White, Emmylou Harris or whoever it is for you, but you let them be. “Music City” has always been a safe haven for musicians. It’s where they raise their kids and buy their groceries. It’s their home and people generally want to protect that. Today we explore that idea of home by going into the houses of two very different Nashville musicians. The first is Roger Weismeyer, a classically trained English horn and piano player who plays for the Nashville Symphony. The second, the introverted indie rocker, Ben Elkins of the band El El. To get to know what our musical neighbors and their spaces are like we have come up with a format that includes a bit of music. We go to their house and ask them to play two songs: One, an original, played in the space in which they often create, write, and practice. The second, a cover of a song that for them is the pinnacle of what they want to achieve in music. Since they create not only music but their lives in these houses, we ask them to tell us about a meaningful object in their home and see where that takes us.</p>\r\n      ",

            "description": "\r\n        <p>This is a story about a ritual. A Chinese tea ceremony. It's used as a means to connect — with the past, with people, with another land. Joshua Drake Wu invited me into his home to experience the joy of Chinese tea. I learned a lot of surprising things about tea, hospitality, and my neighbor. Make yourself a cup of your favorite leaf and listen. Also in this episode are the rituals of two of my podcasting colleagues, Jonathan Hirsch of ARRVLS and Vannessa Lowe of Nocturne. They are two great shows you should check out. Special thanks to Jason Goforth and Dan Burns for some of the music in this episode.</p>\r\n      ",
