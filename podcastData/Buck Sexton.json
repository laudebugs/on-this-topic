The claims go a step further saying Trump is paying them to do so.\n\n\"This is so outlandish and defamatory and just bizarre. This is why this report, which people are saying it is tied to some former British Intel Official... , wasn't published and wasn't used by the Hillary oppo. team and you know they'll fight as dirty as they possibly can. They'll go dirty, I mean Hillary loves to go dirty but she also knows that a blatant and obvious forgery would hurt the cause and would help Trump\" says Sexton\n\nThe Buck Sexton Show, Weekdays 12–3pm ET on The Blaze Radio.\n\nTwitter: @BuckSexton\nFacebook: Buck Sexton",

North Korea has started a new missile program working with weapons capable of reaching the United States and other nations. Plus, Gordon shares more on his prediction that China will collapse.\n\n\"This is a threat we know will mature within the first term of President Trump.\"\n\n\"I think the Chinese state is unstable. It has an economy that is growing maybe half the reported 6.7% rate. They've been creating debt five times faster than GDP. They have an incomplete leadership transition ... and they've got a military which is becoming much more influential in policy circles. None of this is taking China in the right directions and I believe the country is fragile.\" - Gordon Chang\n\nThe Buck Sexton Show, Weekdays 12–3pm ET on The Blaze Radio.\nTwitter: @BuckSexton\nFacebook: Buck Sexton",
