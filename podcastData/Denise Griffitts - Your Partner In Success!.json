They were only allowed to bring $25 with them and had to start over in life. While growing up, it was normal for all the parents to have conversations about money. How much things cost, how much they spent, and how much people earned. He observed the way they were making wise decisions, and how the community quickly achieved financial success. Rocky never realized this wasn't how everyone else talked about money. He learned most people don’t talk about money and are more likely to share their sex lives than their money story. \r\n\r\nPutting profit first in your business doesn’t mean ditching everything you care about to only focus on the money. Instead, it’s one simple change to the financial equation. This ensures that everyone (including you!) gets paid along with all of your bills. No more running check to check and wondering why there’s no money in your bank account. \r\n\r\nFind Rocky on the Web: Website | LinkedIn | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\r\n\r\n \r\n",

            "description": "The System Is Unforgiving: Play By The Rules And Win. Regardless of your circumstances, if you apply Allen’s rules to all aspects of your life, you will succeed in the face of any opposition.\r\n\r\nHumble upbringings did not deter Allen Maxwell from an incredible and dynamic global journey in the Navy and later in the private sector as a defense contractor. While navigating complex dynamics in both worlds, he developed the 'Rules of the System' that would be critical to survive challenging circumstances such as serving in the Philippines amid political unrest, a near-death collision on the USS Kinkaid, and a devious internal plan to usurp his leadership in Guantanamo Bay. As a businessman, he lost millions, saw the underbelly of politics, and steadfastly gained back his prosperity with a new insight on his allies. He came to resolutely know that while the system can be unforgiving, nothing is personal. With the right Rules of the System to follow, you will win.\r\n\r\nAllen also volunteers as the Chief Financial Officer for a non-profit organization that mentors students  - ensuring they graduate from college is one of its focus points. In a different focus, they mentor foster youth who are exiting the program. He is Treasurer for the American Legion Riders Group, a 32nd Degree Twice Past Master Mason, and an active Deacon at Mt. Erie Baptist Church in San Diego, California. \r\n\r\nWebsite | Amazon | LinkedIn | Facebook\r\n",

Gray rhinos are not random surprises but occur after a series of warnings and visible evidence. \r\n\r\nMichele Wucker coined the term \"gray rhino\" to draw attention to the obvious risks that are neglected despite – indeed, often because of- their size and likelihood. The metaphor has moved markets, shaped financial policies, and made headlines around the world. Michele’s recent TED Talk has attracted more than two million views. She is the author of three books, most recently the international bestseller, THE GRAY RHINO: How to Recognize and Act on the Obvious Dangers We Ignore, which China’s leadership has used to frame and communicate its crackdown on financial risk. A former media and think tank executive, Michele is the founder of the Chicago-based strategy firm Gray Rhino & Company. She speaks regularly around the world on risk management, macro strategy, and decision-making, and is quoted often in leading media.

            "description": "The earliest documented spam (although the term had not yet been coined) was a message advertising the availability of a new model of Digital Equipment Corporation computers sent by Gary Thuerk to 393 recipients on ARPANET on May 3, 1978. Rather than send a separate message to each person, which was the standard practice at the time, he had an assistant, Carl Gartley, write a single mass email. As the marketing manager at Digital, he was hoping to get attention, particularly from West Coast customers, for Digital's new T-series of VAX systems. Instead, he ended up getting crowned, for better or worse, as the 'Father of Spam'. He prefers to think of himself as the father of e-marketing. There's a difference. \r\n\r\nIn fact, Thuerk's original spam \"did work,\" he says. \"We sold $13 million or $14 million worth\" of the DEC machines through that e-mail campaign. On the negative side, complaints started coming in almost immediately, and a few days after the original e-mail, an ARPANET representative called him up and chewed him out and made him promise never to do it again.\r\n\r\nIn this episode of Your Partner In Success Radio we will delve into history and how Gary failed retirement, misses working in the DoD & AeroSpace Industry, and how he got to work with the people who built the internet technology.\r\n",

His undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Michigan and UCCS in communication, psychology, and marketing were conferred in the highest distinction. \r\n\r\nEthan will share his thoughts on:\r\nEvery day, you're entrusting some of your most important and valuable messages to a form of communication that doesn't differentiate you, doesn't build trust and rapport, and isn't as clear or effective as looking someone in the eye and speaking to her or him.Any business or business process that isn't built on trust, rapport, and relationship will be automated.Any process that is needs a more personal and human touch.Simple webcam and smartphone videos recorded and sent in place of some of your plain, typed-out text can help you with clearer communication, human connection, and higher conversion.

While on a trip to Uganda, the Honeggers met Jalia and Daniel Matovu, who created beautiful handmade goods, but lacked a stable marketplace to ensure their livelihood. Honegger saw a solution to both of their problems: by selling the Matovus’ jewelry back in the US, she could raise funds to adopt her son, while simultaneously generating revenue for Jalia and Daniel. The overwhelming reaction to the Matovus’ story and products propelled Honegger to turn her at-home fundraiser into an actual company, and Noonday Collection was born. \r\n\r\nJessica’s innate desire to create meaningful opportunities for others, paired with an unwavering passion for social entrepreneurism, has earned her notable accolades, including 2015 Person of the Year by Austin lifestyle magazine, TRIBEZA. In 2017, she received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award, which recognizes entrepreneurs who are excelling in areas such as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their business and communities.

An Inc. 5000 company, Keyser has rapidly become one of the fastest-growing firms of its kind in the country, serving companies and their real estate needs globally. \r\n\r\nWhen Jonathan entered the cut-throat, dog-eat-dog world of CRE brokerage, he became the worst version of himself and hated himself because of it.

He abandoned his ruthless ways and reinvented himself as a selfless leader, which skyrocketed his brokerage firm to eight figures in five years. His selfless service approach to business has resonated with corporations and individuals seeking a competitive edge to acquiring and maintaining clients. Jonathan's best-selling book 'You Don’t Have to Be Ruthless to Win: The Art of Badass Selfless Service' and online Keyser Institute courses inspire others to activate selflessness in their life and see how and why this counterintuitive strategy can create extraordinary, long-term success.\r\n\r\nJonathan will share:\r\nWhy helping others is crucial to developing a sustainable and successful business5 things that get in the way of living out your true valuesWhy I pursue intentional imbalance in my lifeThe 15 core principles that I live by -- and how I empower my team to do the same“It’s not about me:” 4 words that changed my lifeWhat I learned during my 30-Day Positivity Challenge",

            "description": "Scott Armstrong joins host Denise Griffitts to discuss performance pivots which can lead to limitless performance.\r\n\r\nThe whole Limitless concept started with Scott Armstrong playing with animals over 30 years ago. Sitting at a soulless desk as a corporate banker, he was deeply frustrated. I knew there had to be more for him than pushing paper. He had done it right - followed the proper path of education and had what most considered a great future in front of him. That was 1986 – and that’s when things changed and he decided to go limitless.\r\n\r\nThree years later he was operating Canada’s largest rehabilitation center for abandoned exotic animals – a lifelong dream come true. As a result, an incredible myriad of wonderful creatures became part of his family – swimming with jaguars, running with wolves, playing in the snow with tigers, helping an owl take flight again. \r\n\r\nHe wanted to help others feel the incredible satisfaction that comes from doing what one loves. My next step – helping people create their own Limitless adventure. Over the last 20 years, he has worked with over 2000 businesses and individuals to help them create and grow.\r\n\r\nFind Scott Armstrong on the web: Website | LinkedIn | Facebook\r\n",

Despite graduating valedictorian from one of the nation’s top chiropractic colleges and running a thriving practice, Dr. Steve found that his outer success did little to calm his inner turmoil.\r\n\r\nThus began a thirty year journey to understand the root of his suffering. His exploration of Western psychotherapy, Eastern teachings of mindfulness, hypnosis, and the science of neurology provided profound insight into the universal nature and cause of suffering; the subconscious mind… which ultimately led to the creation of his successful UnHypnosis system and bestselling book.\r\n\r\nSince then, Dr. Steve’s excitement, motivation and enthusiasm have earned him fans from every profession as he continues to enthrall audiences worldwide, helping them remove mental barriers to achieving their dreams.\r\n\r\nFind Steve Taubman on the web: Website | Amazon Author Page | LinkedIn | Facebook | Twitter\r\n",

Your message, your mission, and your vision will change the lives of millions of people, but only if you get out of your own way. \r\n\r\nOdette Peek Laurie, award-winning entrepreneur and owner of Women on Top Business Coaching, built her first business in 1993 at the age of 27, during Canada’s worst economic crisis. She sold a service to real estate agents, the market hardest hit by the recession. Within five years and against all odds, Odette’s brainchild grew to seven figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nToday Odette helps entrepreneurs achieve their lifetime dreams through the vehicle of entrepreneurship. But it hasn’t always been easy. In her first year as a business coach, Odette lost her love relationship, both her parents passed away and she woke up one morning paralyzed in her arms. She couldn’t move them properly for more than a year. She says, \"I know that business owners are not successful because they are paralyzed by their life circumstances and then use these as an excuse to not go after what they want. But excuses are stupid and stupid is very expensive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOdette has written two books: “Profit Domination: How Successful Women Get on Top and Stay There -- 201 Rules for the Road,” and an account of her personal tragedies while building Women on Top in her most recent book, “Paralyzed: Getting Past the Excuses of Why You Aren’t Successful”.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

Her father, the late Charlie “Tremendous” Jones, founded Executive Books in 1965 with the goal of changing the world one book at a time. After amassing an exceptional leadership background of her own, Tracey took the company’s reins in 2009 – and carries on her father’s tremendous legacy today.\r\n\r\n\r\nA former Air Force officer and Gulf War veteran, Tracey’s storied career in uniform took her from Roswell, New Mexico to stations in Germany and England, where she honed her operational expertise and tremendous leadership skills in a number of command roles. A Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, native, Tracey is a graduate of the New Mexico Military Institute and the Air Force Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore assuming her father’s mantle at Tremendous Life Books, Tracey built an impressive career as a corporate “fixer.”  When she talks about her own experiences, she paints with broad, exciting strokes – her clashes with company “old guards,” her battles with entrenched boards – all successful efforts to effect real, lasting change.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith twelve years in the Air Force, another ten in corporate boardrooms, plus an MBA in Global Management and ongoing Ph.D. work, today Tracey puts her tremendous training to work carrying on her father’s lifelong mission.\r\n\r\nToday Tracey is going to share her thoughts and advice on Leadership. \r\n\r\nLeadership is something that has fascinated her since she was a young girl and her father would pull her up on stage. She grew up sitting at the feet of great leaders from many different industries and  always wanted to be a leader.\r\n",

David became a student of marketing, and knocked it out of the park with his first campaign, which brought in 20% more sales.  When fellow agents saw the results, they said, “Hey Dave, you should be teaching this stuff.”  This led him to write his book From the Bottom Up:  The Ultimate Guide for Business Planning to Profitability.  In 2012 David left the insurance business and started his own consulting business, D Brown & Company, pursuing his passion of marketing and helping others.\r\n\r\nDavid is a firm believer in serving his community.  He became a member of a volunteer board of directors for a community health center in 1987 and worked his way up the ladder becoming President of the Board of Directors for nearly 20 years.  During his tenure the organization grew from a small health center to 4 locations in two counties with a budget over $11 million dollars.  He was elected President of the Michigan Primary Care Association for two terms.  He has also served on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Community Health Centers.  David’s work has earned him several awards from both the State and National Associations.\r\n\r\nListen to earlier interview here.\r\n\r\n \r\n",

A journey that will ignite your life and refuel your career.\r\n\r\nCorporate leaders, midcareer professionals, entrepreneurs and others have sought Ruth Ross out as their guide because she took this journey herself. To her amazement, she realized she was not alone in her feelings of disenfranchisement, anxiety, boredom and apathy.\r\n\r\nThen, she did what many of us think about but rarely do: Stop. Reassess. And commit to the life she wanted to lead.\r\n\r\nThe result is that Ruth created resources to help leaders identify whether the “disengagement disease” is infecting their organizations — or even themselves.\r\n\r\nAs a successful HR executive for top Fortune 500 companies, she realized she felt held hostage by the trappings that come with a “big job.” She was an influencer at her company, yet she felt invisible. Perhaps even more debilitating, she recognized that her work no longer excited her.\r\n\r\nAfter putting a name to these feelings and admitting she was disengaged, she set off on a new path as an advocate for treating this affliction.\r\n\r\nIf Ruth’s story strikes a chord with you, join her on a journey toward reengaging your life and career. You won’t have to pack for this trip. In fact, you’ll end up discarding baggage that might be holding you back from coming alive.\r\n",

And, while we treasure the entrepreneur, one needs not start their own business in order to be one. One can be entrepreneurial within a company setting (often called “intrapreneurs”) and can lead from anywhere they happen to be positioned.\r\n\r\nJohn David Mann, a successful entrepreneur and student of success (and author of numerous books on both topics) shares with us exactly how you – from any position in your company – can create a go-giver culture.\r\n\r\nBut, what exactly IS a go-giver culture? Why will it make your team-members, your customers, and all your stakeholders more loyal? And, how will it make your business, and your life, a lot more fun and much more profitable? We’ll find out in this enlightening discussion.\r\n\r\nBob Burg, coauthor of the international bestseller, The Go-Giver and a much sought-after speaker at sales and leadership conferences, is committed to inspiring the entrepreneurial spirit in us all. He shows that companies both large and small that conduct their businesses “The Go-Giver Way” are not only of much greater value to their customers; they are also significantly more functional, and profitable, as well.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to download the episode on demand here and in iTunes.\r\n",

Today I am interviewing a friend and colleague who is also a leader and expert in online business management and project management with over 8 years experience in the industry. She is also CEO of Business Solutions Made Simple, a multi-VA firm made up of the best and brightest virtual assistants (VA) who specialize in assisting high achieving entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Virtual Assistance industry is experiencing explosive growth, but the downside to that is that there are too many people struggling to find quality, clients. And as Tracey and I have discussed numerous times both privately and publicly, the problem often lies in the depth (or lack thereof) of business knowledge and actual training/education the new VA has acquired.\r\n\r\nWe will talk about:\r\n\r\n\t\tWhat do you need to start a VA business?\r\n\t\tHow do you price your services?\r\n\t\tWhere do you get clients?\r\n\t\tWhat about subcontracting for other VA's?\r\n\t\tHow can you \"level up\" your VA business?\r\n\t\tHow do you manage your time, clients and projects?\r\n\t\tHow can you compete with the \"big dogs\" in the VA industry?\r\n\r\n\tPlease join us in the chat room to ask questions.

Brown learned firsthand the challenges of running a small business. Including the number one reason businesses fail, which is failure to understand their market and their customers’ buying habits. David became a student of marketing, and knocked it out of the park with his first campaign, which brought in 20% more sales. When fellow agents saw the results, they said, “Hey Dave, you should be teaching this stuff.”  This led him to write his bookFrom the Bottom Up: The Ultimate Guide for Business Planning to Profitability. In 2012 David left the insurance business and started his own consulting business, D Brown & Company, pursuing his passion of marketing and helping others. \r\n\r\nDavid is a firm believer in serving his community. He became a member of a volunteer board of directors for a community health center in 1987 and worked his way up the ladder becoming President of the Board of Directors for nearly 20 years. During his tenure the organization grew from a small health center to 4 locations in two counties with a budget over $11 million dollars. He was elected President of the Michigan Primary Care Association for two terms. He has also served on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Community Health Centers. David’s work has earned him several awards from both the State and National Associations. \r\n\r\nAs his book title says, David knows what it’s like to learn “From the Bottom Up,” from starting a business to being President of a multi-million dollar organization. A consummate professional, David’s marketing skills continue to increase his client’s businesses by 20-25%.\r\n\r\nBe sure to join us in the chat room!\r\n",

Well last month, our guest Brad Szollose really explained WHY Millennials act the way they do…if you haven’t listened to it, it was such an eye-opening podcast, I decided to bring Brad back for part 2.\r\n\r\nThe Millennial tech-savvy generation was raised on toys that interacted with them, a parent relationship that was more of an advisory role, and a school system that taught them there was no right and wrong. And that poses very real issues for business owners who employ them and Baby Boomers who are attempting to work side-by-side with them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

He established his own training firm and was soon in demand as a professional speaker.\r\n\r\nDon has been recognized with many honors, most recently the National Speakers Association’s “Master of Influence” Award.  He shares this recognition with leaders that include Ken Blanchard, Jack Kemp, Zig Ziglar and Norman Vincent Peale.  Don is the author of 14 books, including his latest, Selling Value: Key Principle of Value-Based Selling, and his two Wall Street Journal and New York Times best sellers, The One Minute Entrepreneur: the Secret to Creating and Sustaining a Successful Business and the One Minute Negotiator: Simple Steps to Reach Better Agreements.\r\n",

He had written and self-published a little book called \"Tales of the Everyday Workingman (and Woman)\" that he sold an incredible 70,000 copies of (as of that interview date.) For 12 years he worked at a job that he absolutely hated. So much so that his days were consumed with thoughts of quitting. But as a family man with a wife and children to support, that was just not an option.\r\n\r\nThings came to a breaking point in the summer of 2011. He was over $180,000 in debt, his marriage was falling apart, and his children barely knew him because he was always working. The cherry on the cake was that he was 170 pounds overweight.\r\n\r\nIn the back of his mind he had a dream of being a writer. How could that be possible, a guy with no college degree become a writer? More than that, he wanted freedom!\r\n\r\nThree years ago Kimanzi finally got fed up enough to stop existing and to do something about his dream. He decided to stop listening to all those things keeping him from a life that he and his family truly deserved.\r\n\r\nToday he is a contributing writer for The Huffington Post, Entrepreneur Magazine, and Mind Body Green. He is a business editor at The Good Men Project. His mission is to help men and women create true freedom in life.\r\n\r\nToday we are going to pick up the threads on Kimanzi's tale and find out how he lost 170 pounds and moved his family to Maui, Hawaii. We are going to find out how he came so far, so fast, and how you can as well. Yes, you can do that!\r\n\r\n \r\n",

Well, for most self-published authors, this is sadly not the case; in fact, next to poor DIY covers, DIY layout is killing self-published print books to the detriment of the author. To ensure this isn’t the case with your book, The Book Doctor is back with another installment in the “How to Self-Publish with Excellence” series, focusing this week on how to make certain your interior layout is as professional as your cover. If you want your baby to rival—or even exceed—a traditional house publication, it’s crucial to understand the difference between DIY and professional layout artistry, and Stacey will reveal all the secrets! What’s more, she’ll share what you as a writer should look for in contracts when you hire book professionals (editors, cover designers, layout artists, proofreaders, etc.) to safeguard the rights to all of the material you pay for.\r\n\r\nAnd, BONUS! If you didn’t grab it last time, Stacey is once again offering her Master Do’s and Don’ts List of Self-Publishing (with abundant resources!) for Your Partner in Success Radio listeners.

James started his career in marketing as supervisor of a direct-mail printing company, overseeing the day-to-day activities of marketing materials as they worked their way through the creation process and then on to the consumer. Little did James realize at the time, that the numerous hours spent proofreading content were actually preparing him for his future career as copywriter, content strategist and consultant.\r\n\r\nJames is perhaps one of the best-kept secrets in marketing, choosing to work behind the scenes as opposed to today’s \"gurus\" who prefer the limelight.  As James states, \"I've never been much interested in becoming a star personally, I'd much rather help others learn how to shine a little brighter, instead.\" James attributes this attitude of helping others shine brighter to a quote he read by the late great motivational speaker and author, Zig Ziglar, who said, \"You can have everything in life you want, if you just help enough other people get what they want.\" It is upon this principle that we base today’s show; titled: \r\n\r\nGive and It Shall Be Given Unto You: A Success Paradigm\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the following points:\r\nThe Importance of Having a Success ParadigmThe Give & Receive PrincipleMindset vs. Technique\r\nBe sure to join us in the chat room to ask quesitons of either of us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
