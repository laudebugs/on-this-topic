Most have landlords who collect rent for their premises. In turn, many landlords have to pay interest on their loans to the banks. The pandemic is upsetting that delicate financial balance. It's estimated that billions of pounds is owed to landlords in unpaid rents. Threats of legal action against tenants are hitting the headlines. Just who should take more of the financial hit - commercial landlords or their tenants?\n\nGuests\n\nEdward Ziff, Chair and CEO of Town Centre Securities, a property investment firm\nMark Dixon, CEO of International Workplace Group, which rents, develops and sublets office space\nand Charlotte Heyes, director of the small pub chain, Common and Co",

The UK has traditionally been better at basic science research than its commercial exploitation - with examples ranging from computing to the discovery of graphene, where international companies have benefited more from those discoveries. The Bottom Line examines the government‚Äôs idea of creating an agency, similar to the legendary US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), to invest in, and commercialise UK science and technology projects.  \n\nThe US agency DARPA, was set up to invest in technology after they got behind in the space race with the Russian launch of the Sputnik in the 1950's.  Although the agency's remit is to work on defence projects, several of its discoveries have spawned more commercial uses, most famously the Internet.  \n \nNow the UK government wants to emulate this success for civil applications in the hope of encouraging new business sectors of the economy,  post-Covid 19.

Since the deregulation of Europe's airlines in the late 1990s, more and more of us have been flying every year.  Whilst this may be good news for the airline industry, it's not good news for the environment.  Manufacturers are trying to make models lighter and more fuel efficient, with a pledge by IATA to cut emissions to 50% by 2050. Nevertheless, experts say we are at least fifteen years away from hybrid engine powered flight.

But sometimes things can also go wrong not because of bad luck, but because someone makes money out of failure.\n\nThe \"profit or plunder\" question has been raised by events at BHS. It was struggling, facing intense competition in a tough retail environment. But the owner took quite a bit of money out of the company. And the staff pension fund went into deficit. Sir Phillip Green, who was then in charge, sold the business to an inexperienced former bankrupt who didn't make it work and it is now in administration.\n\nThis has made a lot of people angry - but aside from BHS, how do we distinguish between a case that is bad luck, a bad apple, or a system that is badly designed?\n\nJoining Evan Davis in the Bottom Line studio this week are Bruce Davis of peer-to-peer lender Abundance, Breffni Walsh of Brands Are Best and Garry Wilson of private equity firm Endless LLP.",

Without this approach, he believed the company's prospects would be bleak. Some companies will do anything to be big, even if it means cutting prices and making less money. Other businesses are happy to be smaller and more profitable. Which strategy wins?\n\nThe panel also discusses corporate claptrap. Silly jargon, faddish ideas and vacuous concepts - why is the business world so keen on nonsense?\n\nEvan is joined in the studio by Deborah Meaden, entrepreneur and business investor; Keith Clarke, chief executive of FTSE 250 civil engineering and design consultancy Atkins; Hugh Hendry, hedge fund manager and co-founder of Eclectica Asset Management.",

There was concern over the summer that the world's economic powerhouse could be about to enter a double-dip recession, dragging rest of the world down with it. Those fears might may have now subsided, so how is the US economy actually faring? And can the rest of the world thrive without a booming America? The panel also discusses sponsorship - how companies decide which events to back, and how much to spend.\n\nEvan is joined in the studio by Nani Beccalli-Falco, President and Chief Executive of GE International; Trevor Matthews, Chief Executive of Friends Provident; Mike Lynch, founder and Chief Executive of Autonomy.",
