Let me explain....\r\n\r\nLong time friend of Desperate House Witches, (going on 17 years), Tonie Ervin came up with the most creative Esbat held at NCPCOW, I have ever had the honor of participating in....she set everything to a sound track of her favorite artist in the world, Elton John. It was powerful and emotional, singing to well know and well coordinated tracks to call the quarters as well as the Lord and Lady. Hands down, the most unique ceremony I have ever taken part in. I am looking forward to this years Esbat as, while I am a huge fan of Elton, I'm an even bigger fan of Freddie.\r\n\r\nSo we welcome general all around badass, (did I mention she and her husband also run Mystic Artisans?), Tonie for the first time. \r\n",
