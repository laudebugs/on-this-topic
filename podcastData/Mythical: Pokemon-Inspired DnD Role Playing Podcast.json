It is broken down into smaller seasons where new listeners can pick up quickly, but older audiences can still feel invested in the creation of our worlds.\nSeasons 1 and 2 were streamed live on Twitch.tv/pkmncast, and this is the audio version of our episodes. Season 1.5 was recorded at 2016 Gen Con. Season 2.5 was recorded locally with the crew.\nIt's important to note that each Season is self-contained and you do NOT need to listen to Season 1 to enjoy later Seasons.\nMythical is presented to you by PKMNcast.com and the minds that create \"It's Super Effective.\"",
