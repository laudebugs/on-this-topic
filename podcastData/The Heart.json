            "description": "\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.meatpodcast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Meat</em></a>is an international podcast created on the surface of a person’s skin. It is a vision of the world from the point of view of human flesh. In people’s everyday life, there’s a wall between their ideas, dreams and desires and the real world: our body. A cage for the human behaviour made by flesh and bones that affects the way we interact with the rest of the world: the sound of our voice, the line of our movements, the space we take up on a bus because of our weight, the dominant or submissive position we are forced to take when we argue with someone because of our height: our reality is a constant argument between what we have in our head and what the body we are born with is able to do.</p>\n\n<p>In the inaugural episode of <em>Meat</em>, Jonathan Zenti candidly and beautifully discusses his body and how he loves it despite the fact that not everybody else does.</p>\n\n<p>This episode was created for Radiotopia’s Podquest, by PRX and made possible with funds from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.</p>\r\n      ",

The music was originally composed for the episode by the incredible Matthew Daher. <a href=\"http://matthewdahermusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">He just released an EP called Dwelling Lightheartedly In the Futility of Everything. Go get it.</a></p>\n\n<p>You also heard music at the beginning by Man Meets Bear, who also released a <a href=\"https://manmeetsbear.bandcamp.com/album/waagaaskingaa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">new album recently called Wagaskina</a>. It’s also fucking awesome.</p>\n\n<p>So many thanks: editorial genius as always by Mitra Kaboli and Sharon Mashihi. The team and beyond who helped get this episode together: Samara Breger, Jen Ng, Shira Bannerman, Megan Detrie, Julia Murphy, Martin Johnson, Ido Fluk, Hana Crawford and Brendan Baker who gives me advice all the time about everything.</p>\r\n      ",

The moments that you wish lasted longer because they were so intense, so perfect, so everything you’ve ever wanted to feel with another human being. You wish you could document every second of your parallel existences together, to show the world, that your love is the best. But you don’t because, much like the mayfly, it’s going to be over before it can ever really start.</p>\n\n<p>This story was produced with help from Lucas Adams.

It’s a lot harder to be a woman who’s hairier, wider, bigger, taller, square instead of round, straight up and down instead of curvy, big hands, big feet, no vagina and maybe no breasts either. A woman who isn’t quite looking like what some people think a woman should look like. But who is finding her way.</p>\n\n<p>To these women, the world can be downright cruel. More than cruel, violent. Harassment often escalates into assault, and more often than you would like to hear, escalates into full on homicide.</p>\n\n<p>For these women, being womanly in the way we are told we have to is sometimes about more than beauty. It’s about survival. This episode is about the story of one woman’s quest for beauty.</p>\n\n<p>It was a collaboration with badass poet and radio maker, Julia Alsop.
