            "subtitle": "Three remarkable novelists, from very different backgrounds, peel back the curtain on how they write, why they write, and what they write.  Arthur Golden is the author of Memoirs of a Geisha, the only book he's written, and a longtime bestseller. He describes why he rewrote the book three times before he got it right, and explains how he successfully gave voice to a character so unlike himself.  Carol Shields is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Stone Diaries, and many other novels and plays. She talks about why she chose to write almost exclusively about the domestic lives of ordinary women, illuminating their struggles and triumphs.  And Shelby Foote is the noted author of novels about the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, including Shiloh.  He became best-known for his three volume history of the Civil War, and his appearance throughout Ken Burns' documentary on the same subject, but he always considered himself a novelist first and foremost. He talks here about his tumultuous life in the Mississippi Delta, and how adversity shaped him as a writer. ",

It's called CRISPR, and it is an easy, inexpensive process for cutting and pasting DNA - the code of life.  It is already being used in human trials to cure genetic disease, and it promises to transform agriculture, with drought-resistant crops that will better feed the world.  But it also threatens to usher in a frightening era of designer babies and unintended consequences.

Together they brought many award-winning plays to Broadway, including \"Fences,\" \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" and \"The Piano Lesson.\"   August Wilson, who wrote ten plays (together known as the Century Cycle), started out as a poet.

Richards was already an icon in the theater world.  He had begun his career a generation before,  aspiring to be an actor at a time when there were almost no roles for African-Americans.  His big break came when Sidney Poitier asked him to direct a new play called \"A Raisin in the Sun\" by Lorraine Hansberry.

In this episode, Gehry talks about what compelled him to put the art back in architecture.  He explains his obsession with fish and motion and curvilinear forms.  And he remembers the professor who told him he'd never make it in architecture.</p>\n\n      ",

            "subtitle": "Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in 2007, just after she returned from exile in the hopes of becoming Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third time. She had held the position for the first time in the 1980’s, and then again in the 90’s.  When she was still in exile, unsure whether she would ever return to Pakistan to run again, Bhutto sat down with the Academy of Achievement for a long and candid interview.  In this episode of What It Takes, you’ll hear the highlights of that conversation.  She describes how her childhood fed her belief in democracy and women’s rights, as well as her abhorrence of violence and poverty.   She talks openly about the failings of her leadership when she was Prime Minister and the lessons they taught her. It is haunting to hear Benazir’s profound words here and know that Pakistan might have been on a different course were she still alive.   \r\n“I feel that society is like a canvas, and that if you get into office you're given an opportunity to paint it.  And it's up to you whether you make a good picture or whether you make a bad picture.”   ",

In 1952 alone, there were 58,000 cases in the United States.  When news of the discovery was made public on April 12, 1955, Jonas Salk was hailed as a miracle worker. He further endeared himself to the public by refusing to patent the vaccine. He had no desire to profit personally from the discovery, but merely wished to see the vaccine disseminated as widely as possible. The interview with Dr. Salk featured in this episode was recorded in 1991.  In it, Salk talks about being the child of uneducated immigrants, and carving his own path to medical school and eventually virology -- a specialty that didn't exist when he began as a researcher.  He discusses the anti-semitic quotas he had to overcome, as well as the doubt and scorn of many of his peers.  But he also describes the transformation and relief his polio vaccine brought to the world. ",
