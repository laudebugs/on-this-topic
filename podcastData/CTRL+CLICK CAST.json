There are a lot of moving parts, from understanding business rules and tribal knowledge to designing for user experience and building internal systems that work. We tackle all of these points with Noah Bersohn and Peter Compernolle, with a focus on shipping and fulfillment. Noah and Peter share two client case studies, each with unique shipping and fulfillment needs. They detail their approach, which starts with a strong focus on discovery and proceeds quickly to prototyping for validation before diving into full&#45;scale development. They also discuss the ecommerce frameworks and CMSs they use (and prefer), and how to strategically decide when to move from out&#45;of&#45;the&#45;box to plugins or custom dev.\r\n      &amp;lt; Download MP3 &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt; Listen on ctrlclickcast.com &amp;gt;\r\n      \r\n      Show Notes:\r\n            \tCTRL+CLICK ecommerce archive\tCraft\tCraft Commerce\tShopify\tSpree Commerce\tField Notes case study\tThe Eastman Egg Company case study\tConnecting to 3rd&#45;Party APIs\tData&#45;Driven Design\tDiscovery Only\tShipStation\tCraft ShipStation Plugin\t\tLeave us a review on iTunes \tReview our show on Stitcher\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    Sponsored By<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ctrlclickcast/~4/GaxiFvZPTio\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
