    "description": "The Comic Book Page family of podcasts are hosted by John Mayo, a comic book fan who has been reading comics for decades. John buys and reads an average of three or four dozen new comics every week.\n\n\n\nEvery Monday is the Weekly Comics Spotlight with reviews of a current comic by DC, a current comics by Marvel, and a current comic by some other publisher.\n\n\n\nOnce a month are the two Mayo Report episodes. One covers the top 300 comic book sales through Diamond Comics Distribution and the other covers the top trades, hardcovers and other collected editions.\n\n\n\nEach month the Previews Spotlight goes over the hightlights of the Diamond Previews and Marvel Previews.\n\n\n\nOn occasional, a Back Issue Spotlight will be released covering a comic book story arc from years past.\n\n\n\nRound Table Discussions on a comic book related topic or recent convention are done on a sporadic basis.",
