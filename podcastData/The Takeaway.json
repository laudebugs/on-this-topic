Meanwhile, election officials across the country have been working diligently to maintain free and fair elections.

Election officials from across the country describe how Election Day 2020 went and how things could improve for future elections. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>As Joe Biden gets closer to winning the electoral college, the Trump campaign is taking to the courts in an attempt to challenge the results. In the past few days, </span><span>states like Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania have all seen lawsuits calling into question their process of counting ballots, though there’s no evidence supporting the president’s claims of voter fraud.

No other career as prosaic has been glamorized more. In movies and on TV, everyone who works for or as a politician is beautiful, smart, and ambitious. All are doing super important work that is changing the world. Even the interns are drafting amendments that protect our way of life.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>In real life, of course, politics is messy. And, more important, boring. For every election night balloon drop victory party, there are a million days filled with the crushingly tedious work of voter contact and fundraising and town hall meetings filled with cranky and angry constituents.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>But, as we learned this week, it is the people who do the non-glamorous work, those who spend almost every single day of their entire career in relative ambiguity, who help keep our democratic institutions steady. I’m talking about the elected officials, poll workers, and office staff, who ensured that this election - an election taking place in the middle of a health pandemic and with record turnout - was conducted as fairly, smoothly, and judiciously as possible. They are doing this work under great duress and stress. They continue to do their job even as the president of the United States - without any evidence - takes to the White House briefing room to question their integrity.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>When the election is over, these folks aren’t going to get a sweet cable TV gig or their own podcast. Instead, they are going to go back to their offices and prepare for the next election.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>For all of you who are cynical or anxious about the sturdiness of the guardrails protecting our democratic institutions, look no further than the local officials in charge of voting. They are not bowing to pressure from the president. They are not abandoning their posts for fear of political reprisal. They are doing their jobs. And, doing them well.<span> </span></em></p>\r\n<p><em>At the end of the day, it is regular people who are responsible for our democracy. And, the regular people are saving it.\"</em></p>\r\n",

Graham himself, as well as several other vulnerable Republican senators, are hoping that the confirmation of a conservative to the court will help boost GOP enthusiasm and turnout.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>As the hearing wrapped up on Thursday, it was clear that Barrett had made it through the process unscathed. A vote is expected on October 22nd in the Judiciary Committee and by the full Senate at the end of the month. </span><span>We spoke about this with<span> </span></span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sahilkapur\">Sahil Kapur</a></strong>,<strong> </strong><span>national political reporter for NBC News, and<span> </span></span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaTaylor\">Jessica Taylor</a> </strong>of<span> The Cook Political Report. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Also on the show, a look at the political landscape in Texas going into the 2020 election. For years now, Democrats have been predicting they can turn this red state blue. But the<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/08/heres-how-texas-voted-every-presidential-election-/\">last time</a><span> </span>a Democratic presidential candidate actually won the state<span> </span></span><span>was in 1976</span><span>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>However, Texas is changing. A diverse electorate, combined with a backlash to Trump in traditionally Republican suburbs has given Democrats serious political traction. The<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/\"><span>latest polls</span></a><span><span> </span>show President Trump leading Joe Biden by an average of just two points. We got an overview of what’s happening in Texas from<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TexasTribAbby\"><strong>Abby Livingston</strong></a>,<span><span> </span>D.C. Bureau Chief at the Texas Tribune.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>There’s also a Senate race in the state this year. In 2018, a Texas Senate race was the center of the political universe. Then, Democratic Representative Beto O’Rourke raised millions of dollars and gained national attention for his race against Senator Ted Cruz. O’Rourke<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate\"><span>came up short,</span></a><span><span> </span>but his impressive showing gave him enough momentum and fame to mount a presidential run—albeit a short-lived run. Two years later, another Republican Senator, John Cornyn is up for re-election in Texas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>We spoke to his opponent,<span> <a href=\"https://mjfortexas.com/\">MJ Hegar</a></span>, the Democratic Senate candidate and U.S. Air Force veteran, </span><span>about her race against the three-term incumbent. Her campaign brought in<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2020/10/14/nonpartisan-political-report-shows-race-tightening-between-mj-hegar-and-sen-john-cornyn-of-texas\"><span>$13.5 million</span></a><span><span> </span>in the third quarter and she’s been outspending Cornyn in TV ads over the past few weeks. But even though the race is tightening, polls show Cornyn is still ahead by<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/tx/texas_senate_cornyn_vs_hegar-7047.html\"><span>over</span></a><span> seven percentage points</span><span>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>We also took a look at the Latino vote in Texas with<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpcasellas\"><strong>Jason Casellas</strong></a>,<span> </span><span>an associate professor of political science</span><span><span> </span>at the University of Houston.<span> </span></span><span>According to<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/25/texas-hispanic-population-grows-2-million/\">recent estimates</a><span> </span>by the<span> </span></span><span>U.S. Census Bureau,</span><span><span> </span>the Latino population in Texas grew by two million over the last decade,</span><span><span> </span>and it’s on track to become the state’s largest demographic group in 2021. </span></p>\r\n",

Joe Biden used his time to demonstrate that he believes that Trump is a threat to democracy and that reelecting him would mean four more years of divisive politics and the continued mishandling of the coronavirus.  </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToluseO?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Toluse Olorunnipa</a>,</strong><span> </span><span>White House Reporter at The Washington Post,<span> </span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimAlberta\">Tim Alberta</a></strong></span><span>, Chief Political Correspondent at Politico, and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/elainaplott\"><strong>Elaina</strong><span> </span><strong>Plott</strong></a><span>, National Political Reporter at The New York Times analyze the Republican National convention and share what the next 60 days could look like. </span></p>\r\n<p>The economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic has left millions of Americans without work.

They spoke about President Trump's failure to address climate change, structural racism, gun violence, economic insecurity, and the coronavirus that has killed more than 170,000 Americans. A significant portion of the week was dedicated to bringing Republicans into the fold as many shared that they had voted for Trump in 2016 and came to regret doing so. </p>\r\n<p>Headliners like Michelle and Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren stressed that the country is at an inflection point and that those in positions of power are working to dilute American votes. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mayaaking\">Maya King</a><span> </span></strong>from Politico,<span> </span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AsteadWesley?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Astead Herndon</a> </strong>from The New York Times, and<span> </span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_Roarty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Alex Roarty</a> </strong>from<span> McClatchy reflect on the historic convention and how it was received by those watching from home. </span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Yamiche Alcindor</a></strong>, White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour, analyzes how President Trump spent his week.</p>\r\n<p><span>Also, progressives are using a method called “deep canvassing” to engage with voters ahead of November’s general election. These are longer conversations that take place over the phone or in-person with the goal of changing someone’s beliefs by using personal stories and empathy to create a lasting connection. </span><span>In the early 2000s,<span> </span><strong>Steve Deline</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>Ella Barrett</strong><span> </span>got involved with deep canvassing to understand why people had voted against same-sex marriage in California.

What many Americans have finally woken up to is what Black Americans have known for years: That it’s impossible to separate police brutality from the racism that is baked into the structure of every American institution. Institutions, like schools, healthcare, housing, and policing have failed to give Black Americans a level playing field. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>99 years ago, </span>Tulsa, Oklahoma was the site of one of the deadliest and most destructive race massacres in U.S. history. On that day, violent white people took it upon themselves to murder Black Americans and loot their businesses. Black homes, churches, restaurants, drugstores, and doctors offices were razed. In the end, Black Wall Street, one of the most prosperous Black communities, was destroyed. </p>\r\n<p>At a time when Americans are grappling with the role white supremacy played in shaping modern society, President Donald Trump chose to hold a rally in Tulsa during the weekend of Juneteenth.

Protester's demands for police accountability have not waned, forcing officials to address the role of racism in policing and policy. As calls to defund the police grow louder, mayors, police chiefs, and local law enforcement step into the spotlight. At the same time, officials that attempt to reprimand officers for misconduct must face the wrath of powerful police unions. We speak with Kimberly Gardner, the Chief Prosecutor for the City of St. Louis, who was elected on the promise of reform on what it's like to go toe-to-toe with the police. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Guest:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stlouiscityca?lang=en\">Kimberly Gardner</a></strong>, Chief Prosecutor for the city of St. Louis</span></p>\r\n<p> <strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>How the Economy Fails Black Americans</strong></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Not only has the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately hurt Black Americans who've been infected at a higher rate, but the economic uncertainty it's created has set them back in terms of employment. </span></span><span>Black Americans are<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/business/economy/black-workers-inequality-economic-risks.html\"><span>concentrated</span></a><span><span> </span>in parts of the economy that have been designated as essential, like grocery store workers and transit operators.

This week, many primary voters in Georgia were greeted by long lines and malfunctioning voting machines. The chaos surrounding Georgia’s recent election has raised questions about whether or not the same issues will reoccur in November. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Also, George Floyd was laid to rest in Houston following weeks in which thousands of Americans took to the streets to decry police brutality in his name. Meanwhile, Congress is reckoning with how to respond to the protests and calls for police accountability. Two national reporters join Politics with Amy Walter to discuss the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, how Republicans are responding to calls for police accountability, and Georgia’s flawed elections. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Guest Host:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattkatz00\">Matt Katz</a>, WNYC</p>\r\n<p><strong>Guests:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos\"><strong>Nick Fandos</strong></a>,<strong><span> </span></strong><span>Congressional Correspondent for The New York Times</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lbarronlopez\"><strong>Laura Barron-Lopez</strong></a>,<strong><span> </span></strong><span>National Political Reporter at POLITICO </span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Congressman James Clyburn on his Time in the Civil Rights Movement and Addressing Systemic Racism </strong></p>\r\n<p><span>This week, Democrats introduced the Justice in Policing Act on Capitol Hill.  If passed, the bill would prohibit chokeholds, ban some no-knock warrants, track police misconduct at the national level, and make it easier to pursue legal and civil action against the police. The momentum for the bill stems from the uprisings against police brutality after George Floyd was brutally killed by police officers in Minneapolis.
