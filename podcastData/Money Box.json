All children born from September 2002 were given vouchers to invest, the idea being to provide children with some savings at the age of 18, to help with the costs of university or living alone for the first time. Initially £250 was put into the account and another £250 was added when he or she reached the age of seven. For lower-income families, the payment was £500. But it's estimated about a third of eligible young people and their families have no idea these funds exist. So how do you go about finding them?\n\nThe financial regulator is currently consulting on limiting the amount it has to pay out when it fails to operate effectively. Campaigners are concerned it is weakening the  current consumer redress.\n\nMore than two and a half million people have successfully claimed almost £8 billion from the UK government’s Self Employment Income Support Scheme. The scheme was designed to help self employed people whose businesses had suffered because of the economic crisis caused by Covid 19..

Known as the Job Retention Scheme it pays 80 per cent of wages for people kept on by their employer up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. At the time there was disappointment from those who missed out because they didn’t start their job before the scheme’s cut-off date of February 28th.

Guest: Heather Self, Tax Partner, Blick Rothenberg.\n\nPlans to refund the victims of fraud isn’t \"working as well as hoped\" according to financial watchdog the Payment Systems Regulator. Data gathered by the PSR shows that two high street banks who promised to refund victims refused to do so in 96% of cases. Money Box hears from the PSR  Managing Director Chris Hemsley to find out what his organisation is doing about it, what action it wants to see from the banks… and why it isn’t taking tougher action already. Money Box also hears from the son of one victim whose bank initially refused to refund him after criminals used his bank details to steal his life savings of £90k. \n\nThe FCA announced more plans to support households struggling to pay bills due to the impact of coronavirus on incomes.

Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, a business can choose to furlough workers – that is, keep them on the books but not working and at home. The government will pay 80 per cent of their wages up to £2,500 per month. Companies may choose to top up furloughed employee wages to 100 per cent.\n \nHowever, to be eligible for furloughing, workers have to have been in employment with the company on February 28th, 2020. New starters say that unfairly leaves out people who happened to be between jobs on that date. It also means that people who have changed jobs since then cannot ask to be furloughed by their new employer.\n \nWe hear the experiences and concerns of new starters and employers, alongside Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, and employment lawyer Amy Wren of Farrer and Co. Then we put your points to Harriet Baldwin, MP - a Conservative member of the Treasury Select Committee and former economic secretary to the Treasury. \n\nThere's an update on the Financial Conduct Authority's proposals for new rules on lending.

They were billed hundreds of pounds for a period when no-one was living in the property over the summer. After Money Box got in touch, the council looked again at it and concluded that the request for payment was made in error. The charge has now been cancelled. It also reviewed their council tax records for 2019/20 and found no other cases of students being asked to pay. We speak to the editor of the Council Tax Handbook.\n\nPolice forces across the UK have seen a recent spike in cases of what is called courier fraud.  Criminals persuade older people to take cash out of the bank and then give it to a courier to keep it safe. What can potential victims do to avoid being scammed?\n\nEarlier this year we looked at the history of financial mistakes.  We asked listeners to get in touch with their biggest financial mistakes. A number of people told us theirs was buying a flat with Grenfell-style cladding and then being billed tens of thousands of pounds for its removal.

In many cases the local council will not take on these costs so, through a management company, developers impose a so-called rentcharge on the houses to cover these expenses. Legally this means that the management company can take possession of a property if the homeowner gets 40 days behind with their payments - something mortgage lenders don't like.\n\nEvery year more than 4000 people reach state pension age - but do not qualify for a state pension.

The changes are aimed at reducing the high cost of credit for some consumers and making it easier for everyone to compare, and perhaps switch between, different providers. But simpler does not always mean cheaper, as Money Box listener Cathy from Hertfordshire tells us. We also hear from debt campaigner and adviser Sara Williams, who runs the website, Debt Camel.\n\nPresenter: Ruth Alexander\nProducer: Paul Waters",

We discuss how to make financial advice more accessible to everyone.\n\nBanks have until April next year to implement major changes on overdraft charges. The fees from overdrafts bring in nearly two and a half billion pounds a year and they are mainly paid by a small number of customers who are in debt or vulnerable.

It wants to stop firms charging higher prices when customers use an unarranged overdraft and bring an end to fixed daily and monthly fees. Instead the banks will have to charge customers one simple rate of interest on the money owed. But, given that overdraft charges bring in around £4.2 billion a year for the banks, how will they recoup those lost monies? Professor Peter Hahn of the London Institute of Banking and Finance gives his assessment of the planned changes.\n\nAre you going bust? To be blunt, no! That was the first of eight questions in a Q&A sent out this week by the energy supplier, Outfox the Market, to its 100,000 customers.

Universal Credit - which is being gradually introduced across the UK - is supposed to make things simpler, by merging six benefits into one single payment.   But it's been plagued by controversy, especially over delays in paying claimants, causing severe hardship in some cases.   \n\nIn Budget 2018, the Chancellor introduced new measures designed to improve the system.  These include increasing the amount of money people can earn before their benefits are reduced and allowing two weeks extra benefits for those moving from the old system to the new.

But there are legal ways to avoid being hit with a hefty IHT bill.   Whether by donating to charity or giving away cash from surplus income, you can reduce the amount of inheritance tax due on your property, savings and other assets.  \n\nBut how does inheritance tax work and who is liable to pay it?  What must your estate be worth before the 40% charge kicks in?  And if you're married or in a civil partnership,  what are the rules?   \n\n£5.2 billion of IHT was paid last year, a record high.  And yet, it’s still only a relatively small number of people whose estates are liable to so-called death duties.  But many feel they’ve spent a lifetime earning the money and want to pass on as much as they can to their nearest and dearest.

It will also restrict the way direct marketing reaches your email inbox, and means you will be told if your data is compromised by hackers.\n\nWhile the new rules strengthen individual rights, it's a big change for businesses, who are running out of time to comply.

Money Box reporter Marie Keyworth visits Sussex to investigate the cost of living, shopping, exercising and holidaying alone.\n\nUp to 90,000 people on benefits are at risk of losing their home when the Government stops paying the interest on their mortgage in just over two weeks' time. In future, help with mortgage interest will be paid as a loan not a benefit. But new figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show that around 90% of those who get this benefit have not yet signed up for the loan that replaces it. It will be the same amount and still paid direct to their lender. But it will be a loan from the Government and secured against their home. If they do not sign up for the loan arrangement the money will stop from April 6th.

            "description": "More than 90,000 graduates were refunded hundreds of pounds last year after HMRC took payments for their student loan even though they had paid it off. Money Box has discovered these overpayments are routinely taken for many months because HMRC fails to communicate properly with the Student Loans Company. The programme hears from graduates who've experienced this and from tax expert Graham Farquhar at RSM.\n\nThe UK's biggest doorstep lender is in trouble. Shares in Provident Financial plummeted 65% at the end of August. They have recovered slightly but now the company has issued another profit warning after trying to modernise its business and save costs. Doorstep lending began over a hundred years ago. Local agents arrange loans in customers' homes and collect repayments weekly. The sums involved are often small. But the interest charged is very high - more than 500% on a six month loan. \nA former Provident Financial Agent Ian sheds light on how the business of doorstep lending works. And Peter Tutton from the debt charity Stepchange outlines his concerns.\n\nBig changes are coming in the way that investment funds treat their clients. From January they will have to bill customers separately for the cost of research - at the moment it is bundled into the annual charges. Some funds - like the US mutual Vanguard - have said they will absorb all research costs. That could bring charges down. But there are other changes all being brought in under a European Directive that could put charges up. Louise Oliver, Chartered Wealth Manager and Director of Piercefield Oliver and Gina Miller, Director of fund manager SCM Direct, debate the issues.",

Stockmarket fluctuations, our increasing longevity and well-meaning changes to pensions policy by successive governments have helped make these sorts of schemes unaffordable. At the same time, something equally fundamental has been happening to the structure of the workplace as well as the nature of the relationship and expectations between employer and employee. \n\nThe last 10 years has seen the closure of 60% of schemes which would guarantee you a 'wage' in retirement. Since 2012 a system of auto enrollment has instead required all employers to offer a pension that employees are opted into by default. But these come without any assurances about future pay outs and contribution rates are low.\n\nSo what role do employers' pension schemes now have in providing us with a comfortable retirement? \n\nPresenter: Adam Shaw\nProducer: Alex Lewis \nEditor: Andrew Smith.",

Making Tax Digital, cutting the tax free dividend allowance, reducing the amount that can be paid into a pension, and a lot of anti-tax avoidance measures were binned. Will they return if the Conservatives win the Election on 8 June? \n\nSix million first generation smart electricity and gas meters installed in homes since 2012 may have to be replaced to make them work with a new communications network which was switched on in November but is still not being used. Despite that, energy companies are busy installing more of these early models to meet a government target to get one in every home by the end of 2020. The new design is still being tested with the new network and are not expected to be installed until later this year. DCC, the company responsible for the network, will shortly begin a consultation on how the old meters might be connected to it. A spokesman agreed it was possible that they would all have to be replaced.

And retail banking consultant Richard Emery, who specialises in investigating credit and debit card and online banking fraud, reveals the six steps he thinks banks should take to really crack down on the fraudsters.\n\nAlso, cheaper energy when it rains. A new hydro power scheme in Bethesda in Gwynedd is offering locally generated cut price energy to selected households who are willing to change their energy consumption habits. We hear how it works and whether it and other overseas local energy schemes could be models for more of us paying less for energy. We'll also ask whether even the incentive of lower bills is enough to make us alter our patterns of energy use?\n\nAnd - the government estimates that we each have, on average, 25 password-protected online accounts. That's a lot of passwords to remember. If you write them down, you risk invalidating your consumer protection. If you make them too repetitive, a fraudster who breaches security on one of your accounts might gain access to all the rest too.

Vodafone also faces the prospect of a heavy fine from Ofcom for the way it has handled complaints. Money Box has been speaking to some disgruntled customers - and they've highlighted some intriguing tactics about how best to get a problem sorted. Helen Dewdney, founder of The Complaining Cow blog, joins the programme. \n\n\nShould you go public or private? We're talking divorce not health. There is a trend among wealthy people to employ a private judge to negotiate the financial settlement between them and the one they used to love. The agreement they make has to be approved by a judge in court but then becomes a binding award. It will certainly save time, avoiding the backlog of cases in the public court system, and it is all private. And family lawyers expect private justice to spread to those of more modest means. But what does it cost? Joanne Edwards, head of family law at Forsters law firm, will explain all.",

Flexible working - is it too much in the employer's favour?\n\nZero hours contracts, short hours contracts and self-employment are all on the rise in Britain, giving workers less job security and less automatic entitlement to paid holidays or paid sick leave. Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct was criticised by a committee of MPs earlier this month over working practises at one of his warehouses. MPs heard how workers were fined for being late and subject to searches and surveillance. Mr Ashley admitted that in the past some workers had not been paid the legal minimum wage. But employers - both in the private and public sector - say they have to keep costs low in a competitive global market and that means having flexibility over hiring and shedding staff quickly. \n\nJoin Adam Shaw and guests to explore the position of the modern worker.

But they're complicated, and technical.
