We will do a reaction to Doctor Mike Varshavski's video on the topic called Va...Controversies and a CHALLENGE to Doctor Mike and any other expert in this area to come on the program to debate this topic with Dr. Sherri as the goal is to be more informed and to get to the Truth without the name-calling or insults but looking into the evidence and the science, as we are for science, safety, and good for humanity. This is NOT about blindly picking sides it's our sincere humble effort to get to the Truth of the matter.\n\nDr. Sherri J is board certified in three medical specialties.\nDr. Sherri J has been a guest on hundreds of radio and national television programs (including the Dr.Oz Show and the Today Show Australia). She has lectured at Cleveland State University and Case Western Reserve Medical School and has been a speaker at conventions, both nationally and internationally, as a recognized expert on wide range topics within the field of Integrative Medicine.\n\nWATCH MY PREVIOUS VIDEO ▶https://youtu.be/HiY4aSGHnpY\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE ▶ http://bit.ly/1CtXGai\n\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING!

            "description": "Alexander - a convert to Islam grew up in a communist family in former Yugoslavia and remained in Bosnia after Yugoslavia fell apart.\r\n\r\nHe is an actor who lives and works in Sarajevo, a capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina and this interview was done during Eddie's visit to Bosnia few months ago.\r\n\r\nAlexander talks about the natural tendency that is inherent in human nature to seek and submit to God (Allah) which came very easy to him.\r\n\r\nEddie mentions about how Alexander appreciates Islam as a convert to Islam more than many Muslims that were born in Muslim families.\r\n\r\nAlexander talks about his appreciation for finding out about Islam and comparing with his previous life and having a much better life experiences now as a Muslim. This may be the case with lot of converts to Islam.\r\n\r\nHe had near-death experiences during the Bosnian war 92-95 which made him think more deeply about death and salvation and he feels being on the safe side as a Muslim now.\r\n\r\nSome traditional views on Islam in Bosnia was also mentioned and some misconceptions that mostly comes from people's ignorance and prejudice.\r\n\r\nAlexander did his pilgrimage to Makka as well and he was enlightened with the experience to see how Islam transcends borders, skin color, nationality, languages, etc. and unites people to line up in prayer before their Lord.\r\n\r\nHis siblings also are converts to Islam and they lead a nice and fulfilling lives.\r\n\r\nThe video includes a clip of a Serbian priest on a Serbian TV interview praising Muslim women for their chastity and the way they dress protecting themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nThe Orthodox priest mentions a Christian youth on the other side not dressing appropriately and inviting to sin and expresses his dissatisfaction with the current state of their affairs.\r\n\r\nHit subscribe http://bit.ly/1CtXGai\r\n\r\nHelp Support our Efforts at least pledge $1\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thedeenshow\r\n\r\nJoin me also at\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedeenshowtv\r\nhttp://twitter.com/thedeenshow\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDeenShowTV\r\nhttps://www.snapchat.com/add/thedeenshow\r\nwww.TheDeenshow.com",

            "description": "Hit subscribe http://bit.ly/1CtXGai\r\nThe definitive biography of an American icon, from a New York Times best-selling author with unique access to Ali’s inner circle\r\n\r\nHe was the wittiest, the prettiest, the strongest, the bravest, and, of course, the greatest (as he told us himself). Muhammad Ali was one of the twentieth century’s most fantastic figures and arguably the most famous man on the planet.\r\n\r\nBut until now, he has never been the subject of a complete, unauthorized biography. Jonathan Eig, hailed by Ken Burns as one of America’s master storytellers, radically reshapes our understanding of the complicated man who was Ali. Eig had access to all the key people in Ali’s life, including his three surviving wives and his managers. He conducted more than 500 interviews and uncovered thousands of pages of previously unreleased FBI and Justice Department files, as well dozens of hours of newly discovered audiotaped interviews from the 1960s. Collectively, they tell Ali’s story like never before—the story of a man who was flawed and uncertain and brave beyond belief.\r\n\r\n“I am America,” he once declared. “I am the part you won’t recognize. But get used to me—black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.”\r\n\r\nHe was born Cassius Clay in racially segregated Louisville, Kentucky, the son of a sign painter and a housekeeper. He went on to become a heavyweight boxer with a dazzling mix of power and speed, a warrior for racial pride, a comedian, a preacher, a poet, a draft resister, an actor, and a lover. Millions hated him when he changed his religion, changed his name, and refused to fight in the Vietnam War. He fought his way back, winning hearts, but at great cost. Like so many boxers, he stayed too long.\r\n\r\nJonathan Eig’s Ali reveals Ali in the complexity he deserves, shedding important new light on his politics, religion, personal life, and neurological condition. Ali is a story about America, about race, about a brutal sport, and about a courageous man who shook up the world.\r\n\r\nSupport our Efforts pledge $1\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thedeenshow\r\n\r\nJoin me also at\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedeenshowtv\r\nhttp://twitter.com/thedeenshow\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDeenShowTV\r\nhttps://www.snapchat.com/add/thedeenshow\r\nwww.TheDeenshow.com",

            "datePublished": "Wed, 10 May 2017 14:28:31 +0000",
            "description": "Through The Eyes of Yadira and Nadir\r\nAssalamu Alaikum. My name is Yadira and my husband is Nadir. I am completely blind and my husband is legally blind. We've been married for eight years and we have three beautiful children. I was raised Catholic, and I met my now husband a few years before I took my shahada. Coming to Islam has been the biggest blessing in my life. I found my husband, and along with him, came a wonderful family. My in-laws have treated me as their own daughter, and for that, I am extremely grateful. Through Islam, I was blessed with my beautiful children.\r\n\r\nAlas, Allah's bounty and mercy have undeniably been immense, and I'm certainly humbled by this. Yet, I found that upon converting, I was at a loss as to where to acquire information on this incredible deen I had now embraced. I found myself asking to read an English translation of the holy Quran, books of the prophets, books on Ahadith, or any books that could provide me with further insight on my new found religion. However, I was always told to simply listen to audio recordings of the information I was requesting. In fact, this response still rings true to date. Now, as helpful as my fellow Muslims were attempting to be, they did not seem to comprehend the importance of being able to offer literature on Islam in braille to the blind Muslim community.\r\n\r\nAbove is a smiling image of the founders of Islam by Touch Yadira and Nadir. They are standing side by side in a couples half hug wearing black attire.\r\nA Priceless Gift\r\nContact us!\r\nYadira, wearing a purple hijab and black dress is reading brail.\r\nOne of the greatest gifts we have been endowed with is the gift of literacy. To be able to read means to be able to encounter worlds beyond our reality and daily musings. Being able to read means to be able to expand our imaginations to unexplored Heights. Above all however, having the ability to read for oneself, means possessing the choice to fill our minds with limitless knowledge. Of course, it isn't to say that listening to books and lectures does not induce its own unique and enriching experience, but to be presented with a choice to read for oneself provides A chance for deeper reflection and connection to The facts and stories being absorbed.\r\n\r\nEnabling the blind Muslim members of the community the opportunity to read Islamic literature in braille would allow for the same choice to be held as every sighted counterpart. Extending this recourse would permit the opportunity at being engrossed deeply into Islam. It would give the chance to contribute to the community on a meaningful and profound level. The availability and accessibility of Islamic texts would solidify blind Muslims as validated members of the Ummah, and that is exactly what my husband and I are striving to facilitate for all our blind brothers and sisters in Islam.\r\n\r\nHit subscribe http://bit.ly/1CtXGai\r\nJoin me also at\r\nwww.TheDeenshow.com\r\nhttp://twitter.com/thedeenshow\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDeenShowTV\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedeenshowtv\r\nhttps://www.snapchat.com/add/thedeenshow\r\n\r\nHelp Support our Efforts\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1O0dK4b",

He has credibility, so when he debunks myths that Jews around the world hold with blind loyalty, people listen.\"\r\n\r\nThe General's Son. Miko Peled is a peace activist who dares to say in public what others still choose to deny. Born in Jerusalem in 1961 into a well known Zionist family, his grandfather, Dr. Avraham Katsnelson was a Zionist leader and signer of the Israeli Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nHis Father, Matti Peled, was a young officer in the war of 1948 and a general in the war of 1967 when Israel conquered the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and Sinai.\r\n\r\nMiko's unlikely opinions reflect his father's legacy. General Peled was a war hero turned peacemaker.\r\n\r\nMiko grew up in Jerusalem, a multi-ethnic city, but had to leave Israel before he made his first Palestinian friend, the result of his participation in a dialogue group in California.

A graduate from two Ivy League universities with subspecialty training in ophthalmology, Dr. Brown served as a respected ophthalmologist in the U.S. Air Force for a period of eight years.\r\n\r\nMidway through his Air Force career, Dr. Brown’s ideal American family’ included a wife, two children, and the requisite two cars and a dog. His country home was crowded with the full array of comforts and toys which clutter the lives of those preoccupied with materialism. Yet Dr. Brown ended up sacrificing virtually everything he had worked for when he faced a religious conviction that overturned his lifelong priorities.\r\n\r\nFollowing a personal miracle through which the life of his daughter was saved, Dr. Brown redirected his focus to religious study in an attempt to make good on a promise made to God. In the process, Dr. Brown followed the chain of revelation through the Abrahamic religions from Judaism to Christianity and, in the end, to Islam.\r\n\r\nDr.Laurence Brown received his B.A. from Cornell University, his MD from Brown University Medical School, and his ophthalmology residency training at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, DC.\r\nRead more about our guest \r\nhttp://leveltruth.com/author.html/?page_id=2\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin me also at\r\nwww.TheDeenshow.com\r\nhttp://twitter.com/thedeenshow\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDeenShowTV\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedeenshowtv\r\nhttps://www.snapchat.com/add/thedeenshow\r\n\r\nHelp Support our Efforts \r\nhttp://bit.ly/1O0dK4b",

What’s more, we often miss the connections between problems in one part of our body and problems elsewhere in our body.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the tragic consequence of not acknowledging the connection between our teeth, dental treatments, and our overall health is no attention is given to the real cause — and treatment for — many chronic health problems.\r\n\r\nWith her many years of experience, Dr. Lina Garcia, a holistic dentist in the Chicago area, looks at many of the prevailing beliefs and practices of conventional dentistry and finds them wanting:\r\n\r\n• Fluoridating water, in Dr. Garcia’s view, does little to stop tooth decay, yet it’s dangerous because it adds a toxic substance to our water.\r\n\r\n• Mercury-amalgam fillings, often the choice of conventional dentists, are an insidious danger, Dr. Garcia believes, because of the possibility of chronic mercury poisoning. And porcelain or ceramic materials are a far safer choice.\r\n\r\n• Root-canal procedures can harm patients because a tooth may harbor an infection after the procedure is done. And dental patients have more reliable alternatives, Dr. Garcia says.\r\n\r\n• The main cause of cavities is poor nutrition, and oral hygiene plays only a secondary role, according to Dr. Garcia.\r\n\r\nDr. Garcia’s philosophy may be best expressed in these words from her chapter entitled Choices: “My years of practice have taught me that the best way to prevent disease is to build your health.”\r\n\r\nJoin me also at\r\nwww.TheDeenshow.com\r\nhttp://twitter.com/thedeenshow\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDeenShowTV\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedeenshowtv\r\nhttps://www.snapchat.com/add/thedeenshow\r\n\r\nHelp Support our Efforts\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1O0dK4b",

There was a golf ball sized tumor in his large intestine, and the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. Chris was 26 years old at the time and at the prime of his life.\r\n\r\nThe oncologist told Chris that he was “insane” because he decided against chemotherapy after surgery.\r\n\r\nAfter prayer and deep consideration Chris radically changed his diet and did every natural non-toxic therapy he could find.\r\n\r\nChris started a blog in 2010 to share his story and everything he'd learned about nutrition and natural therapies for cancer. He also started sharing cancer healing testimonials from other Cancer survivors.

            "description": "Hit subscribe http://bit.ly/1CtXGai\r\nMeet Asadullah Ali al-Andalusi brought up in a\r\nCatholic family became an Atheist shortly after that found an Orthodox Church and finally accepted ISLAM.\r\nThis is his story\r\n\r\nI was born in the United States, my family originated from Spain. My great grandparents migrated to Puerto Rico and then my grandparents migrated to New York. My mother gave me an English name on account of the prejudices she experienced growing up as a child in the U.S. She also insisted that I only learn English as a result so that I would not have to go through what she did. However, on account of my difference in appearance, I still experienced a great deal of prejudice growing up. I also never knew my biological father because he left shortly after I was born.\r\nI was raised Catholic but had no interest in religion. My grandmother was the most devout in our family (and still is in that regard). My mother was only interested in it culturally, but she has never been the practicing type. As I grew older my disinterest in Catholicism manifested into an irritation with religion in general. As a result I went through a teenage phase of “atheism” (if you can call it that) and just disavowed all forms of worship and God. Around the age of 17 I decided I would not pursue university as I was now interested in professional fighting. I became very good at professional TaeKwonDo and developed myself physically. At this point, my life took a turn for the worse. Around the age of 19 I suffered a major accident in a tournament fight, rupturing a disk in my neck. I was told by doctors not to fight again and Ive had pain ever since. At this point I involved myself in petty crimes etc. I became so depressed I tried to kill myself and was also eventually jailed. Shortly thereafter, I decided to turn my life around again and started to take up a religious life. I became Christian (non-denominational) and joined university. I didn’t have anything particular in mind to study so I just picked philosophy as my major on account of my idol — Bruce Lee — having studied the same field.\r\nAs I studied the subject, I became much more critical and open to the world. I started questioning a lot about my faith as a result. I found myself moving from denomination to denomination in search of the “true” Christianity, until I finally ended up in the Greek Orthodox Church. Although not fully content, I thought I had found “true” Christianity at last. I was attracted to their focus on history, their rejection of original sin, and other concepts I had problems with from other denominations. However, perhaps still the most difficult doctrine was the fact that Jesus was God. I understood the Trinity, but the concept still felt as though it was “forced” on to what the scriptures were actually saying.\r\nStill, during this time I debated with atheists and began forming the foundation of the arguments that I use today. I found atheism fascinating and frustrating all at once, which determined me to understand the way atheists think, where they get their ideas, and the validity and soundness of those ideas.\r\nAs time went by, I became more skeptical of my Christianity. I then met a friend during the end of my undergraduate education. He told me he was Muslim and asked me to visit his masjid if I was interested in learning about Islam. We are now still very good friends, but at the time I was unaware of what sort of Islam he practiced.\r\nWhen I took up his offer, I was introduced to to Shi’ism. I spoke with the imam at his masjid over a period of 4-5 months or so (as best as I can recall). I remember distinctly the man’s character — as well as the characters of all those in the masjid. They were highly intellectual and engaged in philosophy more deeply than the average person. They were also all very kind and seemed very devout in their faith. Anyways, as I spoke with this imam over the months, he would tell me about the two main groups within Islam (Sunni and Sh...",

            "title": "30 Most Frequently Asked Questions during Ramadan",
            "datePublished": "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000",
            "description": "1. What is the purpose of fasting?\r\na. Fasting is an exercise in self-control. Refraining from food, drink and intercourse are difficult because these are among the strongest three desires that humans have. By learning to go without these three human needs for a period of time, Muslims learn self-control so that they can apply this to other aspects of their life. For example, a person who went sixteen hours without water can more easily resist the temptation to drink alcohol or do some other forbidden act. This instills the quality of being conscious of God, which is ultimately the purpose of fasting.\r\n2. What is special about Ramadan? Why fast in this month?\r\na. Ramadan is the month in which the Qur’an was first revealed. Allah decided that this month should be singled out as being special in order to commemorate the Qur’an.\r\n3. When should my children start fasting?\r\n\r\na. The Prophet Muhammad taught that children should begin praying at the age of seven. This means that they should learn what prayer is and try to perform it at least sometimes. Then he clarified that they must pray regularly by the age of ten and should be disciplined for not doing so. That gives them three years to learn and understand what they are doing and get used to it. The same rule applies for fasting. Once children reach the age of seven, they should be taught how to fast and encouraged to do so, at least sometimes. By the age of ten, children should be encouraged by their parents to fast the entire month, or as much as they are able to.\r\n4. How sick do you have to be to skip fasting?\r\n\r\na. Someone suffering from an illness where fasting will probably either cause harm to their body, increase their illness, or delay their recovery is excused from fasting. The severity of their illness can be determined by consulting a medical professional. People with a minor cough or slight fever should still fast, because that will not usually cause much harm. Remember that fasting, even when healthy, causes some discomfort, so be careful when deciding whether you are too sick to fast or not.\r\n5. Should pregnant women fast?\r\n\r\na. There are many pregnant women who fast and it neither harms them nor their child. However, this depends on the health and stature of the woman, as well as the season and her lifestyle. Every case is different. It is best to consult a medical professional who is both well versed in pregnancy as well as nutrition to see if there is a real threat to either the mother or child due to fasting. If there is, the pregnant woman should not fast, and make up the days she missed later on.\r\n6. Should breastfeeding women fast?\r\n\r\na. There are many women who breastfeed their children and continue fasting. It neither harms them nor their milk supply. However, this depends on the health and stature of the woman, as well as the season and her lifestyle. Every case is different. It is best to consult a medical professional who is both well versed in breastfeeding as well as nutrition to see if there is a real threat to either the mother or the production of milk due to fasting. If there is, the nursing mother does not need to fast, but will have to make up the days she missed later on.\r\n7. What if a woman has successive pregnancies and is unable to fast for a few years?\r\n\r\na. This situation might make a woman miss several Ramadans and have to make up fasting for a few years past. Usually, when a person misses a fast in Ramadan, they should make it up before the next Ramadan comes in. In the case where someone has missed more than one Ramadan, they have more leniency in spreading these makeup fasts over a longer period of time. It is recommend for women to try making up their fasts in the winter time when days are shorter and spreading them out by fasting one or two days a week, if it is difficult for them due to their circumstances.\r\n8. What if someone has a chronic illness or is really old?\r\n\r\na. People who suffer from a chronic illness or are very old ...",

            "description": "&nbsp Like most of us growing up in America, we've see the Tv Ads \"Milk does a body good\" but after some time of drinking that stuff I came to find out that it wasn't doing me any good because what we grew up drinking wasn't the Real Milk but it was the pasteurized, homogenized, processed fake Junk food.   I started doing some research because I had read about the Miracle of Milk in the Quran   \"There is instruction for you in cattle. From the contents of their bellies, from between the dung and blood, We give you pure milk to drink, easy for drinkers to swallow.\" (Qur'an, 16:66)  Furthermore  it is written in the books of seerah (life biography of the Prophet Muhammad) that on the occasion of m’iraaj (ascension to the heavens) the Prophet peace be upon him was offered wine, or milk as a drink by Jibreel (the angel). The Prophet Muhammad PBUH chose to drink milk upon which Jibreel alaihi salaam commented: you are rightly guided and your Ummah(community) will be as well. (Seerat ibne Hishaam p: 158)  I asked myself how could milk be negatively affecting so many people being the #1 cause of allergic reactions in people according to the FDA, and that answer became very clear after doing my research, it was because we haven't been drinking real milk, we've been drinking pasteurized, homogenized, processed fake Junk food that our bodies are rejecting.   We are an Ummah of Milk but we have been kept away for so long from the beautiful blessings of Real pure Raw Milk, especially if you live in the States where Real Raw Milk is illegal in many states but ironically coca cola and other soft drinks which have absolutely no nutritional value in them and are actually slowly killing people being a root cause of diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, they are legal. Did you get that?  Real Raw Milk that God Almighty gave us is made illegal while Fake disease and cancer causing foods are legal. that's crazy!   But anyways, that's why I've dedicated this episode to help educate you on the difference and why you should really start doing your own research and looking into the benefits of Real Raw Milk and totally avoiding processed Fake juke foods that are slowly but surely killing people.

            "description": "Meet my special guest Prof. Jonathan brown as we talk about the new Atheism and much more. A study conducted in 2011 by the University of Oxford involving 57 researchers who conducted over 40 separate studies in 20 different countries representing a diverse range of cultures indicated that belief is natural. Dr. Justin Barrett of the University of Oxford's Centre forAnthropology and Mind says: \"The preponderance of scientific evidence for the past 10 years or so has shown … a predisposition to see the natural world as designed and purposeful and that some kind of intelligent being is behind that purpose. If we threw a handful [of people] on an island and they raised themselves I think they would believe in God.\" Professor Pascal Boyer, an anthropologist at WashingtonUniversity, says \"Religious thinking seems to be the path of least resistance for our cognitive systems. By contrast, disbelief is generally the work of deliberate, effortful work against our natural cognitive dispositions — hardly the easiest ideology to propagate\" The French Philosopher Henri Bergson said, “Manyhuman societies have been found with no sciences or arts, but none have been found without a religion.\" Science confirms Atheism and disbelief is acquired and very unnatural *Remember there is always hope for everyone even the atheist, if he would just humble himself and sincerely turn his heart to the Almighty and ask for guidance. leave some positive comments maybe you can help inspire someone to come back to the natural way with your kind words. Ref:It's natural to believe in God: Oxford studyhttp://bit.ly/1ZSOtiaChildren are born believers in Godhttp://bit.ly/1kDLjPT Hit subscribe http://bit.ly/1CtXGai Join me also onhttp://twitter.com/thedeenshowhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDeenShowTVhttps://www.instagram.com/thedeenshowtvwww.TheDeenshow.com Help Support our Efforts http://bit.ly/1O0dK4b How I broke my toe and How to heal a Broken Hearthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idKVF... Look into Islam it is Truly a way of life sent by the Creator as a Mercy for all of mankind.

They all brought the same message: worship only God, and stop worshipping human beings and their ideas. Allah is the name of God in Arabic, Arab Christians use the word Allah. Become a Muslim(Any Peaceful person who submits to the Creator alone) Now If you believe there is only One God who should be worshipped, and no one/nothing else has that right but Him, and you believe Muhammad, peace be upon him, was a messenger who brought the same message as all the prophets before him, then you are basically a Muslim.",

He started studying nutrition in 1977, at the age of 20, because he reached a point where he was ‘sick & tired of being sick & tired’ all the time. He had been a very sickly infant & child and he suffered from a long list of chronic ailments for those first 20 years of his life. \r\nBecause the drugs & other treatments prescribed to him by conventional medical doctors almost always made him feel worse, by the age of 20, he was ready for a big change. A change for the better began when he decided to take responsibility for his own health by beginning to educate himself about nutrition and the other fundamentals of health. Jim eventually learned how to achieve and sustain a very high level of vibrant health.\r\nHe has been helping other people improve their health through nutrition on a professional level for 27 years. From 1998 to 2007, he worked as the chief nutritionist at different,nutritionally oriented and busy medical clinics. Jim has a passion for empowering people to know how to improve their health through nutrition. \r\nMore specifically, he teaches people about what he calls – ‘The Ten Fundamental Principles of theArt of Nutrition’ and helps them to develop their ‘nutritional intelligence’. Jim faithfully practices what he teaches about eating and living healthy.\r\nJim is available for private consultations and can be reached at : 773-506-7247 or email Jim at : riffandtheremedy@gmail.com",

            "description": "Praise be to Allaah.\r\nMa’aazif is the plural of mi’zafah, and refers to musical instruments (Fath al-Baari, 10/55), instruments which are played (al-Majmoo’, 11/577). Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated from al-Jawhari (may Allaah have mercy on him) that ma’aazif means singing. In his Sihaah it says that it means musical instruments. It was also said that it refers to the sound of the instruments. In al-Hawaashi by al-Dimyaati (may Allaah have mercy on him) it says: ma’aazif means drums (dufoof, sing. daff) and other instruments which are struck or beaten (Fath al-Baari, 10/55).\r\nEvidence of prohibition in the Qur’aan and Sunnah:\r\nAllaah says in Soorat Luqmaan (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah…” [Luqmaan 31:6]\r\nThe scholar of the ummah, Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: this means singing. Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this means playing the drum (tabl). (Tafseer al-Tabari, 21/40).\r\nAl-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this aayah was revealed concerning singing and musical instruments (lit. woodwind instruments). (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/451).\r\nAl-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this includes all manner of haraam speech, all idle talk and falsehood, and all nonsense that encourages kufr and disobedience; the words of those who say things to refute the truth and argue in support of falsehood to defeat the truth; and backbiting, slander, lies, insults and curses; the singing and musical instruments of the Shaytaan; and musical instruments which are of no spiritual or worldly benefit. (Tafseer al-Sa’di, 6/150)\r\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The interpretation of the Sahaabah and Taabi’in, that ‘idle talk’ refers to singing, is sufficient. This was reported with saheeh isnaads from Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood. Abu’l-Sahbaa’ said: I asked Ibn Mas’ood about the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), ‘“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks’ [Luqmaan 31:6]. He said: By Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god, this means singing – and he repeated it three times. It was also reported with a saheeh isnaad from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that this means singing. There is no contradiction between the interpretation of “idle talk” as meaning singing and the interpretation of it as meaning stories of the Persians and their kings, and the kings of the Romans, and so on, such as al-Nadr ibn al-Haarith used to tell to the people of Makkah to distract them from the Qur’aan. Both of them are idle talk. Hence Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Idle talk” is falsehood and singing. Some of the Sahaabah said one and some said the other, and some said both. Singing is worse and more harmful than stories of kings, because it leads to zinaa and makes hypocrisy grow (in the heart); it is the trap of the Shaytaan, and it clouds the mind. The way in which it blocks people from the Qur’aan is worse than the way in which other kinds of false talk block them, because people are naturally inclined towards it and tend to want to listen to it. The aayaat condemn replacing the Qur’aan with idle talk in order to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge and taking it as a joke, because when an aayah of the Qur’aan is recited to such a person, he turns his back as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in his ear. If he hears anything of it, he makes fun of it. All of this happens only in the case of the people who are most stubbornly kaafirs and if some of it happens to singers and those who listen to them, they both have a share of this blame. (Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/258-259).\r\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“[Allaah said to Iblees:] And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allaah’s disobedience)…” [al-Israa’ 17:64]\r\n",

            "description": "Praise be to Allaah.Hasheesh of all types is haraam, whether it is marijuana or any other type.\r\nAl-‘Allaamah Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said in al-Fataawa al-Fiqhiyyah (4/233), speaking of hasheeh:\r\nThe evidence for its being forbidden is the report narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan with a saheeh isnaad from Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade all kinds of intoxicants and relaxants. The scholars said that relaxants are things that cause drowsiness and languor in the limbs. This hadeeth indicates that hasheesh in particular is haraam, because it intoxicates and relaxes, which is why those who consume it sleep a great deal. Al-Qaraafi and Ibn Taymiyah narrated that there is scholarly consensus that it is haraam and said: The one who regards it as permissible is a kaafir. He said: The only reason why the four imams (may Allaah have mercy on them) did not speak of it is that it was not known at their time, rather it only appeared at the end of the sixth century AH and the beginning of the seventh century when the Tatar state emerged. End quote.\r\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (3/425): Consuming this hasheesh in solid form is haraam, and it is one of the most evil of haraam plants, whether a little of it is consumed or a lot. End quote.\r\nConsuming intoxicants is haraam regardless of the way in which they are consumed.\r\nAl-‘Allaamah Ibn Qaasim al-Shaafa’i said: What is meant by the drinker is the consumer, whether it is drunk or consumed otherwise, whether there is consensus on its being forbidden or there is a difference of opinion concerning that, and whether it is solid or liquid, cooked or raw. End quote.\r\nSharee’ah only forbids the consumption of drugs and intoxicants because of the great harm that they cause to the mind, soul, family and society. We have discussed some of these harmful effects in the answer to question no. 66227.\r\nAs for stress and anxiety, you may rest assured that the remedy for them is not to be found in smoking hasheesh or any other haraam thing. Allaah has not put the remedy of this ummah in that which He has forbidden to it. In Saheeh Muslim (3670) it says that asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about alcohol and he forbade him or told him not to make it. He said: “But I make it as a remedy.” He said: “It is not a remedy, it is a disease.”\r\nIf you want to rid yourself of anxiety, then we advise you to do several things, including the following:\r\n1- Pray a great deal for forgiveness with proper presence of mind.\r\n2- Do wudoo’ and pray, for these are the greatest means of helping oneself to be patient in dealing with hardship and dispelling worry.\r\n3- Remember Allaah a great deal (dhikr), because this is a sure way to attain peace of mind and tranquillity.\r\n4- Send a great deal of blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). In Sunan al-Tirmidhi (2381) it is narrated that Ubayy (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allaah, I send a great deal of blessings upon you. How much of my du’aa’ should I make for you? He said: “Whatever you wish.” I said: One-quarter? He said: “Whatever you wish, but if you do more it will be better for you.” I said: One half? He said: “Whatever you wish, but if you do more it will be better for you.” I said: Two-thirds? He said: “Whatever you wish, but if you do more it will be better for you.” I said: I will make all my du’aa’ for you. He said: “Then your worries will be taken care of and your sins will be forgiven.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi.\r\nThis is in addition to avoiding the causes of stress and anxiety as much as possible. If the source of this anxiety and stress is worry about the future, such as how you will learn a living and so on, then you must think in positive terms of Allaah and s...",

Verily, Allaah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime).’\r\nO Maryam! ‘Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allaah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raaki‘oon (those who bow down)’”\r\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:42-43]\r\n· Then the angels gave Maryam the glad tidings that Allaah would bestow upon her a child, whom He would create with the word “Be! And it is.” This child’s name was the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary)… He would be held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and he would be a Messenger to the Children of Israel… He would teach the Book and wisdom, and the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel) … And he would have attributes and miracles that no one else would have, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“(Remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allaah gives you the glad tidings of a Word [“Be!” — and he was! i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allaah.\r\nHe will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.’\r\nShe said: ‘O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me.’ He said: ‘So (it will be) for Allaah creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: “Be!” and it is’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:45-47]\r\n· Then Allaah tells us the rest of the glad tidings of the angels to Maryam of her son ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), and of the honour of ‘Eesa, and how He would support him with miracles:\r\n“And He (Allaah) will teach him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] the Book and Al-Hikmah (i.e. the Sunnah, the faultless speech of the Prophets, wisdom), (and) the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).\r\nAnd will make him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] a Messenger to the Children of Israel (saying): ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allaah’s Leave; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I bring the dead to life by Allaah’s Leave. And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses. Surely, therein is a sign for you, if you believe.\r\nAnd I have come confirming that which was before me of the Tawraat (Torah), and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. So fear Allaah and obey me.\r\nTruly, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone). This is the Straight Path’”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:48-51]\r\n· Allaah is absolutely perfect in His powers of Creation. He creates what He wills, how He wills… He created Adam from dust without a father or a mother, and He created Hawwa’ from the rib of Adam from a father but without a mother. He has caused the descendents of Adam to have both a father and a mother, and He created ‘Eesa from his mother without a father… Glory be to the All-Knowing Creator.\r\n· Allaah has explained clearly in the Qur’aan how ‘Eesa was born. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“And mention in the Book (the Qur’aan, O Muhammad, the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.\r\nShe placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Rooh [angel Jibreel (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.\r\nShe said: ‘Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allaah) from you, if you do fear Allaah.’\r\n",

Joe once asked his pastor if Jesus is God, and the son of God how can you be your own father?\r\nJoe realized that God couldn't have been the author of all this confusion so he started his journey looking for the truth. Joe went on to study every world religion and it wasn't until he looked into Islam that everything started to make sense. After long and hard research and intelligent investigation, Joe concluded that Islam was indeed, without any shadow of a doubt, the truth from the Creator sent for all of mankind. Joe went on to get his Masters and to learn the original language of which the Quran was revealed in. This is an amazing story and a reminder that the truth is out there for those who are sincerely looking for it. Joe's Story should be a great motivation and inspiration for you, and everyone else that watches it.",

Verily, Allaah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime).’\r\nO Maryam! ‘Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allaah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raaki‘oon (those who bow down)’”\r\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:42-43]\r\n· Then the angels gave Maryam the glad tidings that Allaah would bestow upon her a child, whom He would create with the word “Be! And it is.” This child’s name was the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary)… He would be held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and he would be a Messenger to the Children of Israel… He would teach the Book and wisdom, and the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel) … And he would have attributes and miracles that no one else would have, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“(Remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allaah gives you the glad tidings of a Word [“Be!” — and he was! i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allaah.\r\nHe will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.’\r\nShe said: ‘O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me.’ He said: ‘So (it will be) for Allaah creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: “Be!” and it is’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:45-47]\r\n· Then Allaah tells us the rest of the glad tidings of the angels to Maryam of her son ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), and of the honour of ‘Eesa, and how He would support him with miracles:\r\n“And He (Allaah) will teach him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] the Book and Al-Hikmah (i.e. the Sunnah, the faultless speech of the Prophets, wisdom), (and) the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).\r\nAnd will make him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] a Messenger to the Children of Israel (saying): ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allaah’s Leave; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I bring the dead to life by Allaah’s Leave. And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses. Surely, therein is a sign for you, if you believe.\r\nAnd I have come confirming that which was before me of the Tawraat (Torah), and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. So fear Allaah and obey me.\r\nTruly, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone). This is the Straight Path’”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:48-51]\r\n· Allaah is absolutely perfect in His powers of Creation. He creates what He wills, how He wills… He created Adam from dust without a father or a mother, and He created Hawwa’ from the rib of Adam from a father but without a mother. He has caused the descendents of Adam to have both a father and a mother, and He created ‘Eesa from his mother without a father… Glory be to the All-Knowing Creator.\r\n· Allaah has explained clearly in the Qur’aan how ‘Eesa was born. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“And mention in the Book (the Qur’aan, O Muhammad, the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.\r\nShe placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Rooh [angel Jibreel (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.\r\nShe said: ‘Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allaah) from you, if you do fear Allaah.’\r\n",

            "description": "Praise be to Allaah.  \r\n \r\nThe blessing of time is one of the greatest blessings that Allaah can bestow upon His slaves. Allaah even swears by time in some cases, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \r\n“By Al‑‘Asr (the time)”\r\n[al-‘Asr 103:1] \r\n- because of the importance and blessing of time.  \r\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Make the most of five things before five others: life before death, health before sickness, free time before becoming busy, youth before old age, and wealth before poverty.” See Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 1077. \r\nBut most people are unaware of the importance of this blessing and are neglectful of their duties towards it, namely to fill it with acts of gratitude and obedience towards Allaah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two blessings which many people do not make the most of and thus lose out: good health and free time.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6412. \r\nAl-Teebi said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened the Muslim (who is accountable for his deeds) to a merchant who has capital and seeks to make a profit whilst also preserving his capital. The way to do that is to look for the right people to deal with and he himself will be honest and will try to be smart lest he be cheated. Good health and free time are our capital, and we should deal with Allaah with faith, striving against the evil inclinations of our nafs and the enemy of religion i.e., the Shaytaan, so that we may attain the best in this world and in the Hereafter. This is similar to what is mentioned in the passage where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \r\n“Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment?”\r\n[al-Saff 61:10] \r\nWe should avoid following the dictates of the nafs and keep away from the Shaytaan lest we lose both our capital and our profit. \r\nFath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar. \r\nIf time is so important, then the Muslim should not have any free time, for he should be going from one act of worship and obedience to another. If he cannot spend all his time going from one act of obedience and worship to another then, he may spend some of his time in permissible pursuits, in which he should ensure that his intention is correct, so that he may earn reward thereby, as Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I get up and I sleep, and I hope for the same when I sleep as I hope for when I get up.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6923; Muslim, 1854. \r\nThe problem that the sister is suffering from is caused by several things: \r\nFirstly: she does not understand the value of time. This is true of many people, as stated above. Even worse than that, by neglecting this great blessing, her spare time has become something destructive, and she regards it as an enemy that she wants to kill, but she does not realize that she is killing herself.  \r\nSecondly: she feels depressed. There is no doubt that wasting one's time and one's life causes deep depression in man, because he feels that he is like an animal that eats so it can sleep, and sleeps so it can eat. Hence we see many disbelievers ended their life by suicide, after being afflicted by depression and other incurable diseases – may Allaah keep us safe and sound from that with which He has tested them. One of the primary causes of depression is disobedience towards Allaah. Undoubtedly wasting time watching TV leads a person to commit sin, such as watching and listening to haraam things, wasting time, and other things caused by this evil machine. The benefits that the sister gains by joining a halaqah for memorizing Qur’aan are largely cancelled out, if not erased entirely, by sitting in front of the TV. Just as good deeds erase bad deeds, bad deeds cause good deeds to be lost. \r\n[You can refer to the Books section of this website; in Dealing with Worries and Stress you will find more details about the causes of worry and how to overcome them.",

            "description": "Praise be to Allaah.\r\nAll praise be to Allah, the lord of the universe. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon Mohammad, His last messenger.\r\nThe purpose of this hand-out is to correct a false idea spread among those willing to adopt Islam as their faith. Some people have a wrong notion that entering into th Islamic fold requires an announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking scholars or shaikhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other authorities. It is also thought that the act accepting Islam, should, as a condition, have a certificate issued by the authorities, as evidence to that effect.\r\nWe wish to clarify that whole matter is very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required. For Allah, Almighty, is above all comprehension and knows well the secrets of all hearts. Nevertheless, those who are going to adopt Islam as their religion are advised to register themselves as Muslims with the concerned governmental agency, as this procedure may facilitate for them many matters including the possibility of performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) and Umrah.\r\nIf anyone has a real desire to be a muslim and has full conviction and strong belief that Islam is the true religion ordained by Allah for all human-being, then, one should pronounce the “shahada”, the testimony of faith, without further delay. The Holy Qur’an is explicit on this regard as Allah states :\r\n“The Religion in the sight of Allah is Islam” (Qur’an 3:19)\r\nin another verse of the Holy Qur’an, Allah states :\r\n“If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (Submission to Allah), Never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (their selves in the hell fire).” (Qur’an 3:85)\r\nIn addition, Islam is the only religion prevailing over all other religions. Allah states in the Holy Qur’an :\r\n“To thee We sent the Scripture in the truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety :…. (Qur’an 5:48)\r\nMohammad, the Prophet of Allah (Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), said :\r\n“The superstructure of Islam is raised on five (pillars) : testifying that there is no God (none truly to be worshipped) but Allah, and that Mohammad is the messenger of Allah, performing the prayer, paying the Zakah (poor-due), fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj.”\r\nThe Shahada can be declared as follows :\r\n“ASH-HADU ANLA ELAHA ILLA-ALLAH WA ASH-HADU ANNA MOHAMMADAN RASUL-ALLAH”.\r\nThe English translation is :\r\n“I bear witness that there is no deity (none truly to be worshipped) but, Allah, and I bear witness that Mohammad is the messenger of Allah.”\r\nHowever, it would not be sufficient for anyone to only utter this testimony oraly either in private or in public; but rather, he should believe in it by heart with a firm conviction and unshakeable faith. If one is truly sincere and complies with the teachings of Islam in all his life, he will find himself a new born person.\r\nThis will move him to strive more and more to improve his character and draw nearer to perfection. The light of the living faith will fill his heart until he becomes the embodiment of that faith.\r\nWhat would be next after declaring oneself a Muslim ? one should then know the real concept underlying this testimony which means the oneness of Allah and meet its requiremants. One must behave accordingly, applying this true faith to every thing one speaks or does.\r\nWhat do the words of the “Shahada” signify? The significant point which every Muslim must know very well is the truth that there is no God (deity) to be worshipped other than Allah. He-glory be to Him – is the only true God, Who alone deserves to be worshipped, since He is the Giver of life and Sustainer and Nourisher of mankind and all creation with His unlimited bounties. Man must worship Allah, Who alone is worthy of worship.\r\nThe second part of the Shahada “i.e., Wa Ash-hadu anna Mohammadan abduhu wa rasuluh” means that Prophet ...",

            "description": "Praise be to Allaah. Defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a kind of kufr. If that is done by a Muslim then it is apostasy on his part, and the authorities have to defend the cause of Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by executing the one who defamed him. If the one who defamed him repents openly and is sincere, that will benefit him before Allaah, although his repentance does not waive the punishment for defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is execution.\r\nIf the person who defames him is a non-Muslim living under a treaty with the Muslim state, then this is a violation of the treaty and he must be executed, but that should be left to the authorities. If a Muslim hears a Christian or anyone else defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) he has to denounce him in strong terms. It is permissible to insult that person because he is the one who started it. How can we not stand up the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? It is also obligatory to report him to the authorities who can carry out the punishment on him. If there is no one who can carry out the hadd punishment of Allaah and stand up for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) then the Muslim has to do whatever he can, so long as that will not lead to further mischief and harm against other people. But if a Muslim hears a kaafir defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he keeps quiet and does not respond for fear that this person may then defame him even more, this is mistaken thinking. With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n“And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge”\r\n[al-An’aam 6:108],\r\nthis does not apply in cases where they defame Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) first. Rather what is meant is that it is forbidden to insult the gods of the mushrikeen first, lest they insult Allaah out of ignorance and enmity on their part. But if they insult Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) first, then we must respond and punish them so as deter them from their kufr and enmity. If we leave the kuffaar and atheists to say whatever they want without denouncing it or punishing them, great mischief will result, which is something that these kuffaar love. No attention should be paid to the one who says that insulting or responding to insults will make him more stubborn. The Muslim has to have a sense of protective jealousy and get angry for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whoever hears the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) being insulted and does not feel any protective jealousy or get angry is not a true believer – we seek refuge with Allaah from humility, kufr and obeying the Shaytaan.\r\nAnd Allaah knows best.\r\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak, Majallat al-Da’wah, Muharram, issue no. 1933.",

            "description": "Ben Carson's Christian “Sharia\" on Homosexuality, Adultery, Women’s rights and Apostasy.\r\nNote: Our Intentions are not to disparage on any of our Christian brothers in humanity. We have been very saddened to hear many of the hurtful and bigoted statements made by Presidential candidate Ben Carson recently about Islam and Muslims. It’s deeply disheartening to see people in his commanding position spreading hate and confusion while deliberating creating fear in the hearts of people. So we had some sincere and honest questions for our brother BenCarson \r\nBen Carson recently criticized and attacked Islam, Muslims and “Sharia”. Remember that Sharia is simply an Arabic word (BTW: a sister language to Aramaic the language Jesus spoke) which simples mean’s God’s Law. For example the Ten Commandments that Moses was given would be considered “Sharia”(The Law)\r\nDear Ben Carson, will your faith and commitment to the Christian “Sharia”(Law) allow you to denounce and reject what is mentioned in the Bible? Since you believe the Bible is 100% word of God Old and NT, and it goes against what you call “the America way.” \r\nSo is BenCarson willing to reject and denounce all of these clear text from his Bible, and to reject the Christian Sharia (Laws,commands in the Bible) as being Supreme as he asking Muslims to do regarding the Quran.\r\n1.Ben Carson will you reject and denounce The Christian 'Sharia' on Homosexuality in the BIBLE\r\nBible says:\"Do not practice homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman. It is a detestable sin.LEVITICUS 18:22 \r\nBible says:\"If a man practices homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman, both men have committed a detestable act. They must both be put to death, for they are guilty of a capital offense. LEVITICUS 20:13 \r\nBible says:\"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” 1 CORINTHIANS 6:9 (New Testament) \r\nBible says:In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. JUDE 1:7 (New Testament) \r\n\"Obviously, these Scriptures leave little room for debate, especially when considered in the light of Romans 1. The only way their message can be negated is to reject the authority of God's Word. Please note, however, that many similar texts condemn heterosexual promiscuity with equal fervor as homosexual behavior. Immorality is immoral whether it occurs between people of the same sex or those of the opposite sex. In both cases, our responsibility is to call sin by its name and to admonish men and women to live in purity and holiness.” Dr.James Dobson Evangelical Christian, Republican Party\r\nNote: For someone who says that Jesus PBUH canceled the OT: In reality Jesus didn’t cancel the Old Testament, but in the BIBLE Jesus said to keep to the “Sharia”( Law, commandments):\r\n\"Do not think that I [Jesus] have come to abolish the Law (the Old Testament) or the teachings of Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to Obey them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke or a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law (the Old Testament) until everything is accomplished. (Matthew 5:17-18)” \r\nMatthew 19:16-22: \"Now behold, one came and said to Him, \"Good Teacher(referring to Jesus), what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?\" So He said to him, \"Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, God alone. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments (Sharia,God’s Laws).\"\r\nJesus also said in the Bible \"If you love me, keep the commandments (Sharia,God’s Laws). John14:15\r\nSo Let’s continue\r\n2.",

Esselstyn, Jr., received his B.A. from Yale University and his M.D. from Western Reserve University. In 1956, pulling the No. 6 oar as a member of the victorious United States rowing team, he was awarded a gold medal at the Olympic Games.

He chaired the Clinic’s Breast Cancer Task Force and headed its Section of Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery. He is a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology. Read more on him here http://www.dresselstyn.com/site/about/about-dr-esselstyn/ Heart Disease: Scope and Impact: *Heart disease (which includes Heart Disease, Stroke and other Cardiovascular Diseases) is the No. 1 cause of death in the United States, killing nearly 787,000 people alone in 2011. *Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics and Whites. For Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Alaska Natives, heart disease is second only to cancer.Heart Disease Scope and Impact PhotoCardiovascular diseases claim more lives than all forms of cancer combined. *Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, killing nearly 380,000 people annually.In the United States, someone has a heart attack every 34 seconds. Every 60 seconds, someone in the United States dies from a heart disease-related event. *About 720,000 people in the U.S. suffer heart attacks each year. Of these, 515,000 are a first heart attack and 205,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack. *In 2011, about 326,200 people experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the United States. Of those treated by emergency medical services, 10.6 percent survived. Of the 19,300 bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the same year, 31.4 percent survived. *Direct and indirect costs of heart disease total more than $320.1 billion. That includes health expenditures and lost productivity. Women & Heart Disease  *Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, and is more deadly than all forms of cancer combined. *While 1 in 31 American women dies from breast cancer each year, 1 in 3 dies of heart disease.Women-and-Heart-Disease-ImageHeart disease causes 1 in 3 women’s deaths each year, killing approximately one woman every minute. *Only 1 in 5 American women believe that heart disease is her greatest health threat. *An estimated 43 million women in the U.S. are affected by heart disease. Ninety percent of women have one or more risk factors for developing heart disease. Since 1984, more women than men have died each year from heart disease. The symptoms of heart disease can be different in women and men, and are often misunderstood. Women and men are not the same when it comes to heart disease.   1.

            "datePublished": "Sat, 29 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000",
            "description": "When we recognize something as being Islamophobic, it typically looks like overt, angry hatred of Muslims. And there is a lot of that to recognize, especially on cable TV: CNN host Chris Cuomo declaring Muslims \"unusually violent\" and \"unusually barbaric,\" or HBO host Bill Maher saying the world's 1.6 billion Muslims are \"like the Mafia\" and share \"too much in common with ISIS,\" or Fox News's Bill O'Reilly calling Islam \"a destructive force,\" and so on. Those kinds of openly hateful statements — or, for example, comparing Islam to Nazi Germany — are what we generally think of when we think of Islamophobia.Focusing on that kind of overt hate is comforting, because it allows us to tell ourselves that the world divides neatly into two categories: that there are the bad people who say the wrong thing and hate Muslims, and then there are the rest of us, and we're doing fine, so we have nothing to worry about.But this narrow way of thinking about Islamophobia is a lie, even if it's a comforting one. In fact, there is another way that Islamophobia often manifests, one that is less overt and less hostile, but no less destructive — and one that is not limited to people who openly spout hatred on cable TV. This other kind of Islamophobia shows up in the subtle expression of stereotypes and prejudices about Muslims and their way of life: the presumption that simply because of their religion or ethnicity, Muslims and Arabs are violent, backward, misogynist, and anti-Semitic. That unlike \"us\" they are less than \"normal,\" or even less than human.This Islamophobia is a kind of soft bigotry of low expectations, and it's everywhere. Former CNN host Larry King illustrated it perfectly, in this stunning anecdote captured by the New York Times's Mark Leibovich:A dark-skinned man approached and asked King if he would pose for a photo.\"Where are you from?\" King asked.\"Saudi Arabia,\" the man said.\"I’m a Jew!\" King informed him. \"You sure it’s O.K. to get your picture taken with a Jew back in Saudi Arabia?\"The man assured him that indeed Larry King had many fans in Saudi Arabia. They smiled for the picture. \"Thank you, Mr. King,\" the man said. They shook hands, and King looked him in the eye. \"Now,\" he said, \"please, go fight ISIS!\"What makes this offensive is pretty readily apparent (which is, presumably, why it is included in the excellent Times story): King's assumption that a person from Saudi Arabia must therefore hate Jews, as well as his patronizing and bizarre admonishment to \"go fight ISIS,\" which seems to assume that all Muslims everywhere are, by virtue of their religion, accountable for taking on the group.But offensive as it was, King's message was largely within the bounds of mainstream US media discourse about Muslims. He was being unusually immodest with his words, and the anecdote is drawing outsize attention because of his fame. But the basic pattern of his exchange with the Saudi gentleman was unfortunately all too familiar: Start by assuming that the Muslim or Arab people in question are probably backward and primitive, shower them with condescending praise if they turn out to behave normally, and tell them that they are personally responsible for stopping violent Muslim extremism — never mind that Muslims themselves are by far the most common victims of this extremism.",

We'll also talk about a growing epidemic of so many women who finish their education(can also include divorced,widowed,etc..) but can't get Married and a very pragmatic Solution that can solve this big problem that Many Christians are also moving towards.",

            "description": "ATHEIST TO BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN TO ISLAM\r\nHe was Born and raised in the US as a Christian and later converted to Islam after studying religion and searching for the truth.\r\nGrowing up in America there are subtle and inherited aspects of Christianity in society but religion is not a major factor in many people’s daily life. Since I was very young my grandmother would bring me to church on the weekends and there would be the regular Bible studies as well as summer camps. As I got older I was less involved in church and spent more time with school, sports and so on. I was always in advanced math and sciences courses throughout my school year and had a high interest in them.\r\nDuring high school I left religion altogether and became an Atheist, especially after discussing some matters with a particular teacher who was a staunch Atheist. I later joined the military when I turned 17 and was still in high school. It was around this time that I renewed my faith and became a born-again Christian. Through reviewing the actual arguments of the Atheists one can see that the argument against belief in God is shallow and while the claim that belief is illogical one sees that it is the only true conclusion for one who reflects on science, nature and reality. It was after this experience that I began reading the Bible daily, praying actively and really being religious.\r\nThen after that summer 9/11 happened. Every where in the news and at every social gathering people were discussing how Muslims believe that the more disbelievers they kill the better their place in Heaven will be and other beliefs that would make one never even want to take an interest in knowing such a “savage” religion. Many people stop there and develop a blind hate for Islam and I did as well. I was your average white American in the military who had a strong hate against Islam and Muslims. For many months this only became further hardened by the non-stop media coverage of everything evil about Islam.",

            "description": "Miko Peled was born in Jerusalem into a famous and influential Israeli Zionist family. His father was a famous General in the Israeli Army, of which Miko also served his time. When Miko's niece was killed by Palestinian suicide bombers, you may have expected the family to put Palestinians at fault, but surprisingly they blamed the state of Israel, and their violent torturing and persecution for driving people to such sadness that they would take their own lives.\r\nThrough his father's deep knowledge of the Israeli war of terror, together with his own research, Miko Peled ruins the myths surrounding the Israel and Palestine situation, and delivers a truth so damning that many Jews and Israel supporters will not be able to bear it. He reveals facts such as the original expelled Jews are not the ones returning, and they are not their descendants either, covers the double standards regarding the right of return, which doesn't apply to Palestinians, and dispels the myth that there has been a conflict for ages by producing proof that it was peaceful up until 1947 when Israel launched their illegal attacks.\r\nIt is a true eye-opener for anyone who has for too long been blinded by the fake misinformation given by the mainstream media, and the truths come straight from the heartland where he has spent many years documenting the real story.",
