            "description": "Following the 2020 election results, Pastor Gary Hamrick delivers a reminder from Matthew 10 on how we are to live as followers of Christ no matter who occupies the White House.  The American Christian life has been too comfortable for too long.  But times are changing.  Lines are being drawn in the sand.  Christians cannot remain silent or complacent.  Just look at the early disciples and how they were martyred for their faith! Jesus says that when we live for Him we should expect opposition and hostility even from within our own families.  He is sending us out “as sheep among wolves.”",

Is it OK to be a “single issue voter”?  Should abortion be more important than other issues in an Election like immigration, health care, the environment, and social justice?  Pastor Gary answers these questions and more in today’s study from Matthew 8.  He also reminds us that at the end of the day, no matter who gets elected, our hope is in the Lord, the Maker of Heaven and Earth.",

            "description": "In Matthew 8, Jesus heals a man with leprosy.  In Biblical times leprosy was a debilitating, deadly disease.  It was commonly thought that God would strike a person with leprosy as punishment for sin in his/her life.  But that wasn’t true; leprosy wasn’t a punishment for sin but it was a picture of sin.  There are several parallels between leprosy and our sin nature. And the cure that the man in Matthew 8 received for his leprosy is the same cure that we need for our sinfulness—a miracle from God.  Through his sacrifice on the cross, Jesus offers us that miraculous cure for our terminal illness (our leprosy). We can be cleansed from the disease that is killing us and be made brand new creatures in Christ! \r\n\r\n",

To be disengaged and apathetic will result in the advancement of a liberal, progressive, demonic-inspired agenda that is bent on the destruction of America.  Christians need to wake up and realize that we are in a spiritual battle for the heart and soul of our nation and the heart and soul of the next generation. Stand up for righteousness!

Being on “Team Jesus” means we have a relationship with Him and will obey Him.  The Sermon on the Mount is not just about words, but a way of life for followers of Jesus Christ.  He is the narrow way that leads to life.  He is the Rock on whom we build our lives.\r\n\r\n",

We have to be wise and discerning about others.  But it can’t be based on assumptions, appearances, or our personal preferences.  In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches us the difference between making right judgments (which is good) and being judgmental (which is bad).

The world’s approach is completely the opposite.  But as Christians we must follow His example even when the rest of the world lives and acts differently. Jesus is not calling us to be pacifists or to roll over and let people take advantage of us.

He gives us a new heart, a new start, and a new identity.  The heritage we receive is not as important as the legacy we leave.  Jesus’ own family tree was littered with human failure, and yet it did not define Him.  In addition, God used imperfect people in that family tree to accomplish His perfect purposes.

There is no other process and no other person through which we can be saved.  The idea that there is only “one way” to God (instead of multiple paths) leaves some to believe that Christianity is narrow-minded and bigoted.  But would those same people believe the same thing if just one cure were found for cancer, or one door led you out of a burning building?  Of course not!  They would welcome the single way to be cured or rescued without feeling deprived that there were not many ways.  So it is with Jesus Christ—He is God’s one way to be saved.  Amazingly, God has provided Him to all who would believe and receive.  There is room in Heaven for you!\r\n",

And though Lazarus was only raised temporarily (he would die again later), it is a picture of how Jesus has the power over death and the grave. This is the reason Jesus said, “I AM the resurrection and the life.”  For Believers, we have the assurance that there is life after death!  Heaven is real, but so is Hell.  And Heaven is open wide to all who would believe and receive Jesus as the resurrection and the life!

            "description": "Light and darkness are used in the Bible as metaphors for good and evil, right and wrong, truth and error.  Jesus said, “I AM the light of the world.”  He came to illuminate dark hearts, dark minds, dark deeds, and a dark world.  He is the contrast to everything that is hidden, secretive, sinful, and covert.  And He calls us to step into the light—to come into relationship with Him and allow Him to cleanse our sinful, secretive hearts and deliver us from a dark, covert world.  Jesus wants to RESCUE and REPURPOSE us.  He wants to take us out of darkness into His wonderful light and then use us to shine His light in a dark world.  Open your Bibles to John 8:12 and join Pastor Gary in today’s study about how Jesus is the Light of the World.\r\n",

            "description": "Pastor Gary continues with the “I AM” series looking at the words of Jesus from John 6:35 when He said, “I AM the Bread of Life.”  Many people try to fulfill certain longings of the human heart with physical or material solutions, only to find that they still feel empty. The reason?  Because only Jesus can really satisfy the deepest longings of the soul.  Every person has four basic needs for love, acceptance, identity, and security.  Unfortunately many people try to get those needs met in ways that don’t really satisfy and that sometimes lead to addiction in the attempt to fulfill those needs.  Learn today why Jesus is the only real solution to the deepest needs of the human heart.",

In this introduction to the series, Pastor Gary explains that when Jesus said “I AM” He was actually connecting His words with an event from Exodus 3 when God used the same expression in giving His proper Name to Moses.  Thus, Jesus was explicitly asserting His divinity—that He is God.  Join Pastor Gary for part one of an 8-part series on “Jesus is the I AM”.\r\n\r\n",

He outlines three things that pave this road—TEARS, TORTURE, and TRIUMPH—Jesus wept, Jesus was crucified, and Jesus rose from the dead!  Every other religious leader who has died still occupies a tomb.  Only the tomb of Jesus Christ is empty! Jesus died and rose from the dead conquering sin and death on our behalf, and now through Him we can have a relationship with God.

It is true that Jesus was and is all those things—a Miracle-Worker, King, and Prophet… but Jesus is more than that!  And the only group of people who embraced Jesus for His true identity were the children!  In Matthew 21 when Jesus came into Jerusalem after riding a donkey down the Palm Sunday road, the children exclaimed, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”  The title “Son of David” is a Messianic title.  In other words, the children were ascribing to Jesus the title reserved exclusively for the One who would come as Savior and Lord!

The teaching is entitled “Infectious Faith” as a play on words because we are dealing with an infectious disease and the infectious fear that goes along with it.  But how can we as Christians have such a trusting faith in God during times like these that our faith is infectious to those around us who are anxious and worried? Pastor Gary first shares an historical perspective on viruses in our world and whether this COVID-19 is somehow related to the End Times.  He then teaches a Biblical perspective of how we can lean on the Lord and have His peace during times like these.  Join us today for “Infectious Faith.”",

We never know what’s going on in someone’s life—the heartaches, the personal struggles, the disappointments, the failures, etc.  Those things lay beneath the surface.  But what if we could draw out those things in a way that resulted in genuine, Christ-like compassion for them?  Wouldn’t that reflect Jesus better than reacting and getting frustrated about someone’s actions or behavior?  This is the angle that Pastor Gary takes in our study through the book of Haggai, and he shares his own personal encounter with a woman from Auschwitz whom the Lord used to teach him about these truths.

He takes us on a progression of faith from confusion to consolation; from being perplexed to being at peace with God.  Life is filled with unanswered “Why’s”, and we can either torment ourselves trying to understand what God is up to, or we can learn to rest in the Lord and trust Him.

So many people carry around guilt and shame from the past and desperately want to feel forgiven.  There is a practice today among Jewish people called “Tashlich” where they stand along the bank of a river or along the coast of the ocean and read from Micah 7:18-19 while casting bread into the water to symbolize their sins being cast into the depths of the sea.  As a symbolic gesture, casting bread into the water is fine; but there is a forgiveness that comes through Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all guilt and shame!  Follow along as Pastor Gary shares about how our sins are cast into the Sea of Forgetfulness.",

However some dismiss the story as FICTIONAL (along the lines of Moby Dick), and others argue it’s only ALLEGORICAL (a picture of God’s love and forgiveness of sinners, but not a true story).  Yet, Jesus mentioned it twice in Matthew’s gospel (Chapters 12 and 16) as a FACTUAL story.  And that’s how we should interpret it too—a real story with real people and real events that illustrate a central theme:  the mercy of God.  We all need God’s mercy (His love, compassion, and kindness)! Join us for today’s study as Pastor Gary highlights 4 characteristics of God’s Mercy from the book of Jonah that are important for us to understand for our lives.\r\n ",

How could a dispersed, oppressed, and nearly massacred people ever be reestablished as a nation?  Answer—by the providential hand of God.  Around the turn of the 20th century, God began moving in the hearts of Jews dispersed around the world to return to Israel (to make “aliyah”).  The Zionist movement began, and there was a revival of the Hebrew language, and the British Parliament had partitioned the Middle East to allow a homeland for the Jewish people.  On May 14, 1948 David Ben-Gurion declared Israel’s independence and in response every neighboring Arab nation attacked Israel.  But when the dust had settled, the State of Israel emerged by the powerful hand of God.  It was a fulfillment of Ezekiel 36-37.

In Ezekiel 22, God is looking for one person who will intercede on behalf of the Jewish people because they have allowed spiritual and moral decay to compromise their lives.  But He found no one.  In a specific sense, this is a picture of how there is a gap between God and humanity caused by man’s sinfulness.  God looked for a man to stand in the gap but He found no one, so He sent His Son, Jesus Christ to bridge that gap.  But in a generic sense, this is a reminder about how God has shown favor to a larger group of people because of the faithfulness of one person to stand in the gap and intercede on behalf of those he/she cares about.  Don’t discount how you can be the one to stand in the gap for your marriage, your family, your friends, your nation!  God often honors the one on behalf of the many.",

Blame-shifting has been going on since the beginning of human history.  When God confronted Adam and Eve about their disobedience, Adam blamed Eve and Eve blamed the serpent.  The theology of responsibility is simply this—every person is accountable to God for his/her own life.  We cannot blame others or make excuses for our behavior or our lives.  “Responsibility” is from two words—response and ability:  the ability to choose a response that no longer blames others or makes excuses for one’s actions.

When He appeared to His disciples on that first day, the first thing He said to them was, “Peace be with you!”  He repeated it two more times.  Why did Jesus choose to emphasize “peace” three times?  Because He knew that mankind’s greatest need was the need for God’s peace—to be at peace with God through a relationship with Jesus Christ.  Join us for today’s teaching from John’s Gospel as Pastor Gary invites people to receive Christ as Lord and Savior and to experience the ultimate peace of God.",

Even those who were rejoicing would soon cry out for His crucifixion when Jesus did not deliver the way they had hoped.  That’s because Jesus’ mission was greater than providing political peace.  Jesus came for the sins of the world to offer us personal peace with God through a relationship with Him.  In today’s message, Pastor Gary connects the Palm Sunday story of the past with the present and the future—looking ahead to a time when all the saints will be worshiping Jesus around the throne of Heaven.",

            "description": "The book of Lamentations is a book that “laments” the destruction of Jerusalem in 586B.C. by the Babylonians.  Lamentations describes the tragic and terrible results of a people who rejected God—a people who refused to turn FROM their idolatry and sin and turn TO God.  The consequences for their sin were devastating. But in the middle of all the sin and destruction and devastation emerges a passage from Chapter 3 about the love, mercy, compassion, and faithfulness of God!  When we realize our own sinful condition and how it can leave us feeling discouraged, bitter, discontent, and distant from God, it’s important to remember that we can run to a God who is loving, compassionate, merciful, and faithful.  And Lamentations 3:23 reminds us that all those qualities about God are new every morning! In other words, every day is a new day and another chance with the Lord!  Whatever might be your past—whether yesterday or years ago—there is a fresh batch of God’s love, mercy, and compassion for you today.\r\n ",

One sad story in the midst of this scene is that of King Zedekiah of Judah whose sons were killed in front of him and whose eyes were then gouged out by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.  Truth is, Zedekiah had lost his vision long before his eyes were put out.  The loss of his physical eyes was only symptomatic of a larger problem—Zedekiah had lost sight of God.

After David had sinned he prayed to God, “Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me” (Psalm 51:12).

In Jeremiah 26, the prophet Jeremiah was threatened with death at the hands of his own countrymen simply because he spoke the truth and stood for what was right.  Nevertheless, Jeremiah remained faithful to God and stood his ground without regard to the personal cost.  God protected him that day, and his life was spared.  But another prophet by the name of Uriah did not fare as well.  While Uriah was a good prophet who spoke the truth like Jeremiah, he ran in fear when people opposed him and threatened his life.  In the end, he was killed.  It’s a sharp contrast for us between those who stand for what is right and enjoy God’s protection, and those who run in fear and are cut down.  Join Pastor Gary in Jeremiah 26 for today’s study, “Stand for What is Right.”",

In fact, it’s better to be in a “bad place” WITH God than to be in a “good place” without Him!  So often God uses difficult situations to purge us of things we need to get rid of in our lives or to grow us in ways we need to mature.  This was the case with the Jews and why God sent them to Babylon for seventy years. Though they saw their circumstances as “bad”, God saw it as “good” because He was accomplishing His good purposes in their lives.  God works in a similar way with us, and Pastor Gary explains it from Jeremiah 24 in today’s teaching, “Good Things Out of a Bad Place”.",

For that reason, we should protect and defend life from the womb to the tomb.

Truth is, you don’t have to carve, pray to, or worship something for it to become an idol.  Anything that compromises our devotion to God or competes with our affection for God is potentially an idol.  An idol is not always something bad itself; it can be a regular thing that becomes an ultimate thing in our lives which we serve with our time, energy, and money.  Are there idols in your life that you have elevated above God?  Are there things, people, or practices that have stolen your heart and rob God of the glory He is due?

Pastor Gary talks about this problem that many people face as we make our way through the opening chapters of Jeremiah in today’s study entitled, “Broken Cisterns.”",

            "description": "If you like TV shows and movies about “time travel”, then you should like the Bible.  The Bible takes us back in time and into the future as well.  It’s about both history and prophecy.  Isaiah concludes his book by giving us a glimpse into the future—to a time even beyond our own day.  He takes us to a time when all people will live in peace; a time when even the animal kingdom will be tame; a time when joy and laughter will fill the streets instead of weeping and crying; a time when people will live long lives, and there will be blessing and prosperity.  Isaiah writes about the time known as “The Millennial Reign of Christ” when Jesus returns to earth and rules and reigns from Jerusalem for 1000 years.  Pastor Gary describes what life will look like in the Millennial Kingdom in today’s study from Isaiah 65-66.",

Does God “grade on the curve?” Pastor Gary answers these questions in our study today of Isaiah 64.  There are myths that our culture believes and there is the truth that God expresses concerning the human condition. If we don’t have a proper, true understanding of the human heart then we will never understand our need for a Savior.  God has provided a way for mankind to be made right with Him through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  We can’t improve our own condition ourselves, but we can get a new heart from our Father in Heaven.",

In addition, God expresses His heart for those who felt excluded.  This is both a warning to those who feel exclusive with God, and a welcome to those who feel excluded from God. It is good for us to examine our own hearts in these areas—do we have any prejudice toward people that we have excluded?  Or perhaps we think that God doesn’t love us or accept us, and we feel excluded.  Both perspectives are wrong and Pastor Gary helps us to align our hearts with the heart of God in today’s study entitled, “All Are Welcome.”\r\n ",

But how is it a loving thing to withhold information about the true and living God from those who are caught up in modern idolatry?

Too often we live for our own glory—our accomplishments, our achievements, our desire for notoriety, etc.  But as Christians, God is to be glorified in ALL that we do.

We often describe these times like a “desert experience.”  Isaiah writes about this theme in Chapter 35 and how God will once again cause the desert to bloom and cause the redeemed of the Lord to be crowned with joy.  In its future interpretation, Isaiah is speaking of the Millennial Kingdom when Christ will rule and reign on Earth for 1000 years.  But in its near interpretation, he writes about God’s sustaining grace through the trials of everyday life.  In 1925 a wonderful Daily Devotional was written by Lettie B. Cowman entitled, Streams in the Desert.  It was inspired by Isaiah 35:6 and it is still published today after more than 90 years!  Born out of her own personal anguish, this Devotional speaks of how Christ refreshed her like a Stream in the Desert.

It wasn’t until they had depleted their resources and exhausted their own efforts that the people of Judah finally turned to God.  When they did, God wasn’t angry and did not shame His people.  There were no “I warned you” or “you should have listened to me” or “I told you so” comments.  Instead God had been waiting for them and eagerly helped them because he is a gracious and compassionate God.  And that’s how he treats us too.  If you’ve been estranged from God, or if you’ve become exhausted trying to do life without Him; if you have a hard time trusting God and surrendering to Him, then follow along in today’s study entitled, “God is Waiting for You.”",

One of the worst types of hypocrisy is how we relate to God.  This was the problem with the Jewish people in Isaiah’s day.  He accuses them of honoring God with their lips (giving God lip service), but not their hearts.  Did you know that according to a recent survey by the Barna Group that “hypocrisy” is the number one reason Millennials (those in their 20’s and early 30’s) give for why they don’t want to attend church?  Hypocrisy is sin.  It not only causes God to be dishonored, but it causes unbelievers to be disillusioned. Join Pastor Gary for today’s teaching on hypocrisy entitled, “All Talk but No Walk.”",

It’s the foundational stone upon which all other stones are aligned.  Isaiah uses building imagery to describe Jesus this way because He is the foundation of the Church and of our salvation.  But in addition, Christ-followers need to ask whether or not He is the cornerstone of every aspect of their lives. In other words, does everything in our lives “square” with Jesus as the Cornerstone, or is He simply only a small brick in the wall of our lives?

Yet he was willing to serve the Lord if God saw fit to use him.  All of us have “ministry”—whether to family, friends, neighbors, or co-workers.  But then there are some that God specifically calls into full-time Christian service.  Could that be you?

As a result, the nation of Judah was guilty of various sins and in danger of destruction by the Assyrian army.  Ironically, the way Isaiah describes his generation is not too dissimilar to our own.  And yet the same hope and remedy for the people of Judah is available to us as well.  Stay tuned to the end of the teaching as Pastor Gary shares a key verse in the book of Isaiah (1:18) to remind us of our merciful Father in Heaven.",

An allegory is a literary tool that communicates a hidden meaning in the story.  Song of Solomon can be seen as God’s love story for us.  Some people have a hard time believing that God loves them.  Some find it difficult to receive God’s unmerited, unconditional love.  But in today’s study, Pastor Gary unpacks the examples of God’s love in this story and encourages us to believe that God loves us and to receive His love for ourselves.",

It’s the romance between a young man and a young woman set to music that describes their courtship, marriage, and ultimate sexual consummation of the relationship.  It can be interpreted allegorically (that it is not a factual relationship, but only a picture that symbolizes God’s love for Israel or Christ’s love for the Church), but a better way to interpret it is literally (with a secondary meaning)—that it is a real, historical, love relationship between a man and a woman which also parallels the love of God for us.  Sex is a gift God has given us to be celebrated between a man and a woman in a monogamous, heterosexual marriage. In part one of this series, Pastor Gary will examine “Courtship Love”—guidelines from this story for those who are in a courting/dating relationship in preparation for marriage.",

Their idea of “Savior” was not one who would die on a cross for their sins, but one who would overthrow Roman occupation and usher in the Jewish Nation.  When that didn’t happen, the people rejected Him altogether and crucified Him.  What do we do when God doesn’t do what we think He should do?  How do we handle life’s disappointments and heartaches when God doesn’t show up the way we had hoped?  Pastor Gary addresses that with some suggestions from Scripture in today’s teaching entitled, “Unmet Expectations.”",

            "description": "The book of Ecclesiastes tackles some hard issues about life.  Written from the perspective of an older man looking back at life, Solomon expresses disappointment, frustration, and regret.  He became jaded and cynical in his latter years due to bad choices he had made over the course of a lifetime.  But Ecclesiastes is not just a depressing journal of an old king, it’s a reminder that someone like Solomon can have everything in life—money, fame, power, success, relationships—and still not be satisfied if God is not in the equation.  His story is repeated countless times in our world.  But by the end of the book, Solomon comes to a wonderful conclusion.  Join us for today’s teaching with Pastor Gary from Ecclesiastes 1.",

Whereas vices are moral weaknesses or character flaws that should be avoided or removed from our lives, virtues are the opposite and we should aspire to make them evident in our lives.  Proverbs has much to say about various virtues, and Pastor Gary will look at four in today’s study:  Humility, Kindness, Integrity, and Honesty.",

Praising God helps us to “verticalize” our lives instead of always looking at the horizontal.

Have you ever struggled with shame and guilt?  Have you ever felt like the Bible imposed a bunch of rules and regulations that restricted your life?

Not that we should judge the importance of a chapter in the Bible based on how many verses it contains, but there is something to be said for the longest chapter in the Bible being about the Bible!  Perhaps we should pay attention to what God emphasizes concerning Scripture and learn about all the many blessings and benefits of applying God's Word to our lives.  In today's introduction to Psalm 119, Pastor Gary lays out the importance of the Bible— how it is Inspired, Inerrant, and Infallible.  In a day when many churches and Christian colleges, universities, and seminaries no longer hold to the authority of God's Word, let us capture a love for the Bible and hold it in high regard as the foundation for faith and practice.\r\n ",

            "description": "A crisis usually drives us to God; trouble in our lives tends to move us toward Him. But what about when life is good? What happens when things are going well? The natural tendency is to forget God when life is good. In fact, the good life is a threat to a godly life. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can learn to enjoy the goodness and blessings of God and still live a godly life. Learn from the mistakes of the Israelites in today's study from Psalm 78. ",

Or that followers of the Lord don't seem to have it any better in life than those who don't?  If you've ever wondered such things, you are not alone.  A man in the Bible by the name of Asaph—an accomplished musician and priest in the Temple of God—thought such things.  And we have a psalm that reveals his innermost struggles about how he wrestled with the justice of God and the apparent unfairness of life.  But a pivotal event happens in his life to help him reconcile these things and the lessons he learns are shared for us in Psalm 73.  Join us as Pastor Gary takes us through this encouraging chapter.",

And the only way to separate the by-products is to put the precious metal in a furnace of intense heat. In the process of refining silver, the intense heat will cause all the impurities (dross) to rise to the surface in order to be skimmed off and discarded. Sometimes God will use the intense heat of difficult life circumstances to cause the impurities of our lives to rise to the surface so that we can deal with those things that mar our lives. God wants to purify and perfect us--to make us more into His image and likeness. Through the patience of our Good Refiner, He will make us into the pure vessels for His use.",

In the book of Job, Job is suffering from unimaginable pain-the death of all ten of his children, the loss of everything materially, and even physical affliction.  If anybody needed a friend, it was Job!  Job had a circle of 5 friends-his wife and 4 buddies-who sometimes proved to be good friends, and who sometimes proved to be not-so-good friends.  In today's study, Pastor Gary takes the good and the bad of Job's friends and translates it into three important principles for being a good friend to someone who is suffering.",

The book opens in Chapter 1 with a drunken dinner party thrown by King Xerxes of Persia for his military leaders, nobles, and officials. When he calls for his wife, Queen Vashti, to entertain his drunken guests by parading herself as a sexual object, she refuses.  It will cost her the throne.  She will be deposed (and perhaps even killed, although the Bible doesn't say so) for refusing the king.  Why was she so willing to lose everything-her status, her fame, her fortune, her crown, and perhaps even her life?  Answer-to protect her dignity.

When he returned to Jerusalem he found that the Jews had allowed four areas to become neglected over time.  In today's conclusion of the book of Nehemiah (and our series through Ezra and Nehemiah), Pastor Gary challenges us about never allowing time to erode our values, convictions, and principles.

In today's study from Nehemiah 7-10, we see how the Israelites shifted their attention from the physical (building the wall of Jerusalem), to the spiritual (building up their lives spiritually).  There were three key disciplines that the Israelites practiced in order to build up their lives spiritually.  Those three things are the topic of today's study with Pastor Gary Hamrick.",

During times of economic hardship, Jews started taking advantage of their fellow Jews by leveraging land and even selling their sons and daughters to each other in slavery.  When Nehemiah realized the problem, he confronted it head-on and rebuked the nobles and officials for such actions.  In the end, land and children were returned to their rightful families and the building of Jerusalem continued.  It's a lesson to us about how we need to serve one another, love one another, and care for one another in the Body of Christ.  It's about how we need to \"look not only to our own interests, but also to the interests of others\" (Phil 2:4).",

We must have contact in a real world with real people to share the real love of Jesus.  But how much contact is too much?  When does \"contact\" become compromise?  Where is the line between influencing a lost world and being influenced by it?  Christians must be distinct and different in our world so that we can offer something that the world needs.  If we look like them, act like them, talk like them, and live like them, why would a lost world think we have anything to offer them?  In 2 Chronicles 17, Jehoshaphat crossed that line and sets an example for us of what not to do.  Join Pastor Gary for today's study entitled, \"Dangerous Alliances.\"\r\n\r\n1) Is my life noticeably different from the culture around me (my values, speech, social behavior) such that others might be prompted to ask me about my life?  (1 Peter 3:15)\r\n2) Do I sometimes feel out of place or uncomfortable in this world?  (Heb. 11:13, John 15:19)\r\n3) Am I intentional about how I can integrate my faith in conversations and social settings?  (Col. 4:6)\r\n4) Am I consciously aware of my witness at all times and do I do my best to keep from compromising or causing others to compromise?  (1 Tim. 1:16, 1 Cor. 10:23-24)\r\n5) Do I believe overall that I am more of an influence in the lives of people who need Christ than they are with me?  (1 Cor. 15:33)\r\n6) Am I more concerned about pleasing God than what my unsaved friends think of me?  (Gal. 1:10)\r\n7) Do I limit dating relationships, business partnerships, and other binding alliances or unions to those who are Believers and who share my biblical world view?  (2 Cor. 6:14-15, Amos 3:3)",

The latter was the case with Judah and the reason why God allowed the Babylonians to besiege the nation.  But whether we created the distance between us and God, or circumstances beyond our control have contributed to that feeling, the good news is that God has never forsaken His people.  He will welcome back the sinner and draw near to the suffering soul!  Join us for today's study in 2 Kings 24-25 as Pastor Gary brings home this point.",

            "description": "After David had been king for about 15 years he fulfilled a promise he had made to his best friend, Jonathan, before Jonathan died in battle:  that he would show kindness to his family as long as he was king.  So David sent for Jonathan's only son-Mephibosheth-whom the Bible describes as being \"crippled in both feet.\"  He restored to Mephibosheth all the inheritance of his family, and promised him the rights and privileges of the king's family by allowing Mephibosheth to always eat at the king's table.  Like a parable, this story teaches us something amazing about the love and kindness of God toward us. \r\n ",

            "description": "As we close out the book of Judges, we see a dismal view of the spiritual and moral condition of Israel.  It tells us in the closing chapters that the Israelites \"did that which was right in their own eyes.\"  In other words, they had not abandoned a sense of right and wrong, but they had rejected God's definition of right and wrong and replaced it with their own.  No nation is safe when it operates independent of God's definition of right and wrong.  Unfortunately, we are heading that direction in America, and Christians must be willing to stand for God's truth and to do what is right in HIS eyes.\r\n ",

One of the saddest verses in all of the Bible describes Samson in Judges 16:20 - \"But he did not know that the Lord had left him.\"  Though Samson was a man who demonstrated some faithful deeds (and that's why he's listed in the 'Hall of Faith' in Hebrews 11), he was not a very faithful person.  He was physically strong, but morally weak.  We can learn a lot from his troubled life.\r\n ",

But when life is good, we tend to forget God.  This was God's warning to the Israelites when they were about to enter the Promised Land - \"When life is good, don't forget Me!\"  Many of us can relate to this important truth!  How can we remember to stay close to God in the good times too?  Find out in today's Bible study as Pastor Gary shares five principles from Deuteronomy 5-9.",

Two angels told them that Jesus had risen from the dead, just as He had said.  When the women reported this great news to the disciples, the disciples thought the women were speaking \"nonsense.\"  But after the Resurrected Lord appeared to them, they finally made sense of the nonsense-Jesus had triumphed over sin and death and offers life to all who believe!

He was then ostracized by his family and imprisoned eight months by the government for trying to proselytize Muslims to faith in Christ.

Frankly, if truth be told, most of us are so earthly minded that we are no heavenly good!  We are usually too preoccupied with life and its challenges that heaven and eternity are only distant thoughts.  Join us today as we study how to live on earth with eternity in mind.",

It cost an entire generation their lives.  So what's the source of temptation, and what should we know about how to resist it?  Find out in today's study with Pastor Gary Hamrick.\r\n",
