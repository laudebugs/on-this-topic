She shares the profound opportunity for transformation that comes with motherhood. We crack open cultural birthing expectations and how they are getting us stuck. I catch myself in a moment of ‘mom judgment’ and, together, we unravel what’s really behind it. Britta also offers healing tools for mothers who have experienced trauma. And we talk about how we can effectively ask partners for what we need and not alienate them with our directness -- a lesson I keep getting to practice.

And psychologist Dr. Kathleen Smith, author of <em>Everything Isn't Terrible: Conquer Your Insecurities, Interrupt Your Anxiety, and Finally Calm Down </em>(Hachette Books, Dec 2019), encourages us to curiously examine our anxiety and our efforts to squelch it. Many of us try to control other people, myself included. \"Because when we feel anxious, we often try to make other people change,\" she writes. \"We try to calm everyone else down so we can finally relax. But if you can work on managing yourself in these relationships, it’s likely that your family, your workplace, and even the greater world will calm down a little too.\" So we pinpoint some ways that we can follow through on this.</p><p>Throughout the episode Dr. Kathleen Smith offers tools for how we can live a calmer, more authentic life, one that isn't defined by what other people think or feel.

We tackle everything from getting to school on time, to mastering the school lunch, to transitioning into the late afternoon without backpacks and shoes all over the floor, as well as techniques for soothing that “after-school” attitude. I even toss in a listener question: How a mother can find more patience with her three year-old now that she’s exhausted from a newborn? Cause honestly, who doesn't hope for a little more patience during major transitions.</p><p>And then I have a parent-teacher meeting with Jennifer Hunt, a second generation early childhood educator. “The best preschool teacher in the world” according to my daughter Sabrina shares with me how the heck she gets all those little kids to actually listen, what advice she has for concerned parents of “the new kid”, what it’s like having her own toddler start preschool, and how you might approach a teacher to be your ally if you’re having behavioral issues at home.

We discuss the straightforward steps Dr. Riess uses to teach empathy and what up to date scientific research reveals about empathy. In a <em>Legally Blonde </em>inspired moment, Ellie pitches her own empathy-related research study idea and is expecting a call from Harvard any minute now. In the meantime, Dr. Riess suggests how empathy can diffuse stressful situations and decrease caregiver burn out and shares why ‘optimal frustration’ is good for our kids. Lastly, she offers a quick tool for calming our nervous system this holiday season.</p><p>Dr. Riess is the founder and chief scientist of Empathetics, Inc.

You’ve seen Dr. Laura Berman&nbsp;as a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Dr. Oz Show, and The Steve Harvey Show.&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author, world renowned sex and relationship educator, and clinical professor of ob-gyn and psychiatry at Northwestern University Dr. Berman is here to help us mamas elevate our relationships with the ultimate “Jedi Mind Trick.” She swears that mastering our energy is the key to living an empowered and loving life. We = atoms. Atoms = energy. And let’s face it, most of us go about our lives unconsciously playing off each other’s energy, for better or worse. In this podcast, Dr. Laura Berman shares with host Ellie Knaus and guest co-host Bridget Moloney-Sinclair findings from her latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Love-Atomic-Energy-Relationship/dp/1401948839\" target=\"_blank\">Quantum Love: Use Your Body’s Atomic Energy to Create the Relationship You Desire.</a>&nbsp;She schools us in how we can cultivate feelings of optimism, hopefulness, and curiosity, and act from an empowered and truthful place as “a co-creator of our reality”. She swears it’s possible to hold onto our positive energetic state (good vibes) regardless of the cranky downers we have to interact with. And you’ll be blown away by the life-changing events that led Dr. Berman to developing this book (it was ‘another freak and growth experience’ (AFGE) after another).</p><p>Because Dr. Laura Berman is a leading expert in sex and love, we also talk about the first-year parenting phenomenon (ya know, the “I want to murder my partner” one) and what that’s really about. We also talk bedroom times: what sex means to men, how we can untangle ourselves from the associated shame, and also how we can raise sexually healthy children. Plus Dr. Berman shares a big-time parenting challenge she recently experienced with her impulsive teenage son and how she consciously handled it with both authority and love.</p>\n      ",

In my second interview with conscious parenting trailblazer Dr. Shefali Tsabary, we share insights from her second New York Times bestseller \"The Awakened Family: A Revolution in Parenting\". This exclusive interview is for anyone who wonders why her kid can drive her crazy…for anyone hungry for external validation…for anyone wishy washy with her parental boundaries. Honestly, it’s a conversation for all humans, with or without kids. And you don’t want to miss Dr. Shefali Tsabary give host Ellie Knaus the best spiritual pep talk ever so that Ellie can finally let go of the performance pressure she has carried since she was a kid. Since taking the the parenting world by storm with her New York Times bestseller \"The Conscious Parent: Transforming Ourselves, Empowering our Children\", Dr. Shefali Tsabary has changed the conversation from how can we fix our kids to how can we heal ourselves.

I can’t wait for you to meet guest SELENA WILLOWS, a mom of two, a nutrition and wellness coach as well as the child swim instructor who taught my toddler to swim safely across a pool in less than two weeks! We’ll talk with Selena about water safety (like the chilling fact that it takes less than 20 seconds for a child to stop fighting for breath), the spiritual experience of witnessing a child push past their fears and perceived limitations, as well as how she coaches. “Swimming is one of those things that children can learn very quickly if people get out of their way,” Selena says. “I often say I don’t so much teach as I facilitate. I provide a safe environment where kids are empowered and they get to learn how to swim — they get to teach themselves how to swim. I guide them, but I do very little instruction.”</p><p>We also go WAY BEYOND swim lessons into Selena’s mantra to “live life on purpose” and her own transformative experience of LOSING 100 pounds. And Selena will offer a “breakthrough homework assignment” for us moms to achieve greater clarity about getting to the root of shame and how it affects us physically inside and out.</p>\n      ",

For those of you in search of your own mom squad, we talk to Janelle about her viral blog: “The No-Bullshit, No-Drama Friendship Manifesto”, the unspoken understanding between best mom friends, and how to cultivate it. We also share why neither of us has chosen a definitive parenting style (or parenting team) and how whenever we think we’ve figured out something as a parent or take parenting credit (lets say for our kid sleeping well, or our pregnancy going smoothly), we end up having to make adjustments or swallow humble pie with the next kid.

Using her childhood home as her personal workshop, she found joy in organizing and re-organizing every room, closet, cabinet and drawer to perfection. As an adult, Robyn continued to hone her skills as a fashion merchandiser and a personal assistant.  After a short-lived career as an actress, Robyn found herself at a professional crossroad. She decided to take a leap of faith and follow her lifelong dream of creating an environment where organizing was her focus and Organize2Harmonize was born. As a long-time member of NAPO (National Association of Professional Organizers),  a Certified Professional Organizer and a Golden Circle Member, Robyn has steadily grown her business into a recognized and trusted name in the organization industry. In addition to being quoted in the Huffington Post, Woman’s Day magazine and numerous other publications, Robyn has also worked on the television show “Hoarders.”  She just published her first book and is working on another one. \n      ",

Sensitive mamas out there, this one is especially for you.\n\nAnd if you listened to last week’s episode with Jordan Reid, Erin’s co-author of \"The Big Fat Activity Book for Pregnant People” (Penguin Random House), you WILL NOT BELIEVE Erin’s side of their ‘meet-cute’ friend story. As much as I want to spill the beans, you’ll have to hear it from her.

From that experience, she discovered the magic of reinvention and promises us, “If you put in the work, and you do the things you say you’re gonna do, your past experiences all make sense.”\n\nOf course, transitions are a b*tch, and her life as an accomplished author and popular website founder isn’t always an Instagram-worthy bed of roses.

Jordan gives us a heart-to-heart about the negative online commenters she’s had to handle in the past and tips for how to rise above the haters (real or imagined). \n\nWe also laugh about her brand new book “The Big Fat Activity Book for Pregnant People”, co-authored by her gal pal Erin Williams, and published by Penguin Random House.

In this candid and inspiring conversation, Helen and Teresa share the life-changing power of friendship, including fun advice for how the rest of us can “pick up” lifelong mom friends.\nFor the first time publicly, Helen opens up about her moment-to-moment decision making when she was diagnosed with stage 3, triple negative breast cancer while pregnant with her second child. She shares her fears at the time of not being present for first child, her countless surgeries and chemotherapy while pregnant, and how they got through it all!

She found her bi-cultural upbringing made it easy to connect with people which lead her to a career in HR, and in the global tech industry. She’s traveled the world for work and play, met her soul mate (also a first gen/Mexican) and chef. They moved to LA when said soul mate-now husband received an offer to open a restaurant in Hollywood. They had their daughter Luna, and soon after, she was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after finding out she was pregnant with her son. She underwent a year of chemo/radiation treatment and gave birth. Now in remission, Helen is the head of talent acquisition for a global tech company in Silicon Beach, and lives in Palms with her family.\n \n Teresa Palmer splits her time between the Hollywood Hills and Adelaide, South Australia with her husband Mark and their kids, 3 yr old son Bodhi and 4 month old son Forest. She also has an almost 9 year old step son, Isaac. Teresa is an actor, director, writer, philanthropist and owner of Your Zen Life and co-founder of our favorite blog: YourZenMama.

Dunn's new book, \"How Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids,\" (Little, Brown and Company) is described as \"part memoir of discovery, part parenting and marriage how-to, and part intriguing exploration of science that explains why we behave the way we do.\" We laugh about what frustrates us most about our partners in Newbornland. For example, I remember in my sleep-deprived haze telling Adam he was not allowed to sit in the driveway with his phone after work and that if he wanted to go to the bathroom right when he got home then he should use the one at the office!... (Sorry, Adam. Can't wait to be back in the thick of it with baby #2 this July!)  Jancee shares communication skills she learned from an FBI hostage negotiator (for her husband, but I swear it applies to toddlers as well), and we discuss the traps of \"maternal gatekeeping\". If you find yourself losing your cool with your partner in front of your child, Jancee offers a powerful suggestion for calming your temper. And if you're struggling to make Quality Family Time (Q.F.T.) in this crazy age of kids sports and non-stop birthday parties, Jancee offers the guilt-free, sure-fire way to get off the hook! Yes, buckle up. We cover a lot of ground!  xx Ellie \n\n\nGuest Bio:\nNew York Times bestselling author Jancee Dunn is the author of five books, including \"But Enough About Me\", a memoir of her rock and roll years, (HarperCollins, 2008) and an essay collection, \"Why Is My Mother Getting A Tattoo? And Other Questions I Wish I Never Had To Answer\", a finalist for the Thurber Prize for American Humor (Ballantine, 2009). In 2012, with Cyndi Lauper, she cowrote \"Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir\". Her first book for children, \"I’m Afraid Your Teddy Has Been Naughty Today\", will be published in 2017 by Candlewick Press. She was a staff writer at Rolling Stone for over a decade, and a veejay at MTV for five years. She writes for many publications, among them the New York Times, Vogue, Food & Wine, and Parents, and was a columnist for GQ and O, The Oprah Magazine.

We’ll talk with Selena about water safety (like the chilling fact that it takes less than 20 seconds for a child to stop fighting for breath),  the spiritual experience of witnessing a child push past their fears and perceived limitations, as well as how she coaches. “Swimming is one of those things that children can learn very quickly if people get out of their way,” Selena says. “I often say I don’t so much teach as I facilitate. I provide a safe environment where kids are empowered and they get to learn how to swim -- they get to teach themselves how to swim. I guide them, but I do very little instruction.”\nWe also go WAY BEYOND swim lessons into Selena’s mantra to “live life on purpose” and her own transformative experience of LOSING 100 pounds.  And Selena will offer a “breakthrough homework assignment” for us moms to achieve greater clarity about getting to the root of shame and how it affects us physically inside and out. P.S.

Host Ellie Knaus (first trimester) consults best mom-friends Becca McHugh (second trimester) and Bridget Moloney-Sinclair (third trimester) about the ups and downs of pregnancy while toddler-wrangling at the same time. We discuss: expanding our families, “second child-itus” (it’s like my stomach was an instant pop-up tent this time), the “mini van stigma”, VBACS, IUI’s, and a bunch of other initials I knew nothing about before motherhood, and how our toddlers pressured us into making them siblings (Sabrina has convinced me that I'm the surrogate for “HER baby”). We hear Becca’s insane ZIKA-conception story, kiss goodbye to any illusions of a cocooned “4th trimester” with the newborn, and share how Sabrina broke the news to her entire preschool. After listening to this episode, our child-free sound engineer Owen O'Neill wrote Ellie: \"Well, that episode was an eye opener to say the least.\" \n\nLeave a review on iTunes (consider it a baby welcoming present): iTunes.com/AtomicMoms\nJoin our conversation on Facebook \"Atomic Moms\" and Twitter/Instagram: @atomicmoms\nSign up for our newsletter on atomicmoms.com \n      ",

Maternity/lifestyle maven and NYC birth doula, Latham schools ELLIE KNAUS and our listeners on her philosophy of “mothering yourself first”,  saying no to make room for yes, and slowing down this winter by tuning into the rhythms of nature (when it's dark at 4 pm, it's fancy pajama time!). Latham tells Ellie about her vision of radical self-care, an act that is radical at least in part because “nobody cares that you want to read a book or lay in bed or sleep in....\" Nobody until now! Finally, we are recognizing for ourselves the absolute necessity of self-care in order to show up wholeheartedly for our loved ones. Latham offers advice on re-charging ourselves at least as often as our iPhones, letting go of our polarizing motherhood archetypes, and answers our \"second round of childbirth\" fears. She also gives Ellie marching orders for how to get her Mama Glow on in the kitchen (hint: it involves this fantastic Atomic Moms community) and you won’t want to miss her recommendation for a ritual each of us can start tonight to strengthen our relationship with our children and to prevent ourselves from getting “off-mission.”  \n \nThis episode is brought to you by Seedling.com, code: ATOMIC \nMama Glow: mamaglow.com\nLatham Thomas’s Instagram: @glowmaven\nAtomic Moms Instagram: @atomicmoms\nAtomicMoms.com \n\"Mama Glow : A Hip Guide to Your Fabulous Abundant Pregnancy\" by Latham Thomas \n      ",

            "description": "\n        You’ve seen her as a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Dr. Oz Show, and The Steve Harvey Show. Our esteemed guest Dr. Laura Berman (New York Times bestselling author, world renowned sex and relationship educator, and clinical professor of ob-gyn and psychiatry at Northwestern University) is here to help us mamas elevate our relationships with the ultimate “Jedi Mind Trick.” She swears that mastering our energy is the key to living an empowered and loving life. We = atoms. Atoms = energy. And let’s face it, most of us go about our lives unconsciously playing off each other’s energy, for better or worse. In this podcast, Dr. Laura Berman shares with host Ellie Knaus and guest co-host Bridget Moloney-Sinclair findings from her latest book, “Quantum Love: Use Your Body’s Atomic Energy to Create the Relationship You Desire.” She schools us in how we can cultivate feelings of optimism, hopefulness, and curiosity, and act from an empowered and truthful place as \"a co-creator of our reality\". She swears it's possible to hold onto our positive energetic state (good vibes) regardless of the cranky downers we have to interact with. And you’ll be blown away by the life-changing events that led Dr. Berman to developing this book (it was 'another freak and growth experience’ (AFGE) after another). \n\nBecause Dr. Laura Berman is a leading expert in sex and love, we also talk about the first-year parenting phenomenon (ya know, the “I want to murder my partner” one) and what that’s really about. We also talk bedroom times: what sex means to men, how we can untangle ourselves from the associated shame, and also how we can raise sexually healthy children. Plus Dr. Berman shares a big-time parenting challenge she recently experienced with her impulsive teenage son and how she consciously handled it with both authority and love.\n\nThank you to Seedling.com for supporting our podcast!

Nikki sat down for a mom-date over a gift of Coor’s Light and homemade “Georgia caviar” to chat about everything from her early years in the Mickey Mouse Club (with the likes of Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling and Britney Spears) to how she worked her way out of the grips of deep postpartum depression while starring on the MTV acclaimed series \"Awkward\". Nikki and Ellie talk about their fast-track playground friendship, how Nikki’s son Hudson is Sabrina’s male counterpart (or, “spirited,” as we like to say), and the healing journey Nikki took with her own mother. Nikki also shares the great awakening she sees happening among fellow women: “I’ve seen us all go on this journey together where we’re like, ‘We are powerful and we are strong and we are leaders but also, we are nurturers and we are lovers and messy, you know, like super messy.’”\nAnd although you know we’re Switzerland here at Atomic Moms, we dip our toes into the presidential election and what it means to and for us.

We learn: how to simplify our family’s morning routine so we don’t lose our marbles, how to calmly handle mealtime struggles, why Montessori classrooms don't have pretend play objects or talking animal books, and how to create a home environment in which our children can thrive as independent learners. Thanks to podcast #97 Ellie is wondering how she’ll get her exercise now that she won’t be sunscreen play-wrestling her toddler every morning. And for listeners with older kids, you won’t want to miss the choice Jeanne-Marie Paynel's own remarkable mother gave her in high school. \n\nGo to atomicmoms.com for show notes and to sign up for Jeanne-Marie Paynel's FREE summit this week!

Growing up in the conservative region of Waziristan where women have zero rights, Maria Toorpakai, age 4, burned all her dresses. Maria's father and brothers helped hide her female identity so she could play sports and roam freely as a boy. Now an internationally ranked squash player, Maria Toorpakai uses her platform to advocate women's rights. In her new memoir, \"A Different Kind of Daughter: The Girl Who Hid from the Taliban in Plain Sight,\" Toorpakai shares, \"Courage in Pakistan is often a fatal virtue.\" Still her courageous parents defied societal expectations and encouraged each of their children to live authentically, even if that meant putting their lives at risk. And Maria's mother, a school principal, continues to travel to dangerous territories in order to build schools for girls.
