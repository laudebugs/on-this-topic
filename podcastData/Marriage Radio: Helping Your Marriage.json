            "description": "You accept responsibility for what you did. You're sorry that you hurt your spouse. You want to put things back together. Not just like it was before but better. <br /><br />The hurt you see in their eyes hurts you. At times their pain explodes in anger. Sometimes toward you; sometimes toward other things. <br /><br />You asked your spouse to forgive you. You told them how sorry you are that it happened. Yet your mate isn't reacting as you had hoped. Maybe they said that they can't forgive what you did. Maybe they haven't made a decision but their actions lead you to believe that when they do it isn't going to be good.<br /><br />Is there something you can do? Are there magic words? Actions? Will you have to live like this for years to come? Or are you already thinking that if they can't forgive, you can't stay because the pain you feel is too great? You don't want to live with a person in perpetual misery. Or everlasting anger. You accept that there are consequences to what you did but you don't feel that you can stay in the marriage only to be punished day after day.<br /><br />If you want your spouse to forgive you and move past where you are now, in this program Dr. Joe Beam explains what to do and what NOT to do. Dr. Beam also takes live calls about other relationship issues or advice you wish to ask about.<br /><br />This program begins at 12:30 p.m. Central Time on Monday, August 3, here on BlogTalkRadio.

You expected your spouse to try to make amends with you. To come back sorry for what they had done. <br /><br />Instead, your mate has indicated little to no interest in restoring a relationship with you or trying to rescue your marriage. <br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Is it you? Are you so unlovely and unlovable that they have no desire to be with you ever again?<br /><br />Is it your mate? Have they become so selfish or hardened toward you that they won't ever care about you again?<br /><br />It's quite a blow to your self-esteem. The hope you had for reconciliation is fading quickly into cynical resignation that what was will never be again.<br /><br />Is there hope? Can someone explain what's happening? Give you direction for maybe making it work?<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Joe Beam explains why spouses don't come back right away. He gives you an understanding of what's happening and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.

Our organization hears these words regularly, \"I knew what I was doing was pushing my spouse away, but didn't understand why or how.\"<br /><br />In his work with couples in crisis over the last 26 years, Dr. Beam has guided thousands to understand why focusing on saving their marriage was the wrong thing to do and what they should be doing instead.

If so, prepare for disappointment.<br /><br />The basis for love beyond the ordinary isn't in finding the right person. Nor is it a technique, formula, or secret hidden from all but the initiated.<br /><br />Exquisite, extraordinary love begins in the most logical place...the only place...that deeply satisfying love can begin.<br /><br />If you hear only the short explanation, you'll miss the power and dismiss it as unimportant. If you listen carefully, probe deeply, and learn wisely, you will unlock the deepest love within you. Love for yourself. For the person worthy of sharing your life. For life itself and anyone in it important to you.<br /><br />Dr. Joe Beam and Kimberly Holmes, M.A., discuss this extraordinary and exquisite love that you can have in their special LIVE program Monday, January 6, beginning at 12:30 p.m. Central Time.

            "description": "Some misguided people claim that the best tactic for rescuing a lost relationship is to practice NO contact.<br /><br />We strongly disagree.<br /><br />No contact is a manipulative method. IF you were somehow to get your ex back by manipulation, how would you keep them in the relationship? More manipulation?<br /><br />The much better method is what we call SMART contact.<br /><br />SMART contact does NOT badger the other person with communication they don't want. NOR does it play the game of NO contact in hopes that somehow that will trigger their missing you. After all, if they want away from you, wouldn't NO contact be exactly what they want. Why, then, would it be the strategy for trying to restore the relationship?<br /><br />SMART contact is just that -- SMART!<br /><br />You may find yourself feeling a strong desire to continually contact your ex during this holiday season. NO contact makes that desire overwhelming. SMART contact guides you to know when and how to contact.<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Beam explains three quick principles of SMART contact that you can use immediately. Then he takes live calls to answer your specific questions.

            "description": "You've heard it phrased in various ways. \"If you love someone, let them go. If they come back to you, they are yours forever. If they don't come back, they never were yours.\"<br /><br />What a ridiculous idea!<br /><br />Maybe it originated with someone trying to help a friend feel better after her lover left her. Or perhaps it started with some guy trying to find a way to feel that it wasn't his fault that his relationship ended.<br /><br />It's wrong. No matter where it began or who says it.<br /><br />We've worked with thousands of couples where one wanted away from the other, denied loving their spouse (or used the \"I love you but I'm not in love with you\" bomb), or even were convinced that they love someone else. Even when it appeared all hope was gone, we've witnessed the majority of these couples who asked us to help turn things around be in love with each other again.<br /><br />Of course, no one seeks help if they follow that dumb idea of \"let them go so that maybe they'll come back.\" Think like that and it IS over.<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Beam takes the first few minutes to explain WHY you should stand for your marriage rather than passively allowing it to end. He also explains WHAT to do that has the best likelihood of rescuing your lost love. For the remainder of the program, he answers questions from those who call in during the live show.

When he's drunk, he exposes the issues with his affair partner, and gets mad at her. Should I attempt this intervention?

            "description": "Dr. Joe Beam has said many times that if your spouse is leaving you for another person that s/he \"madly loves\" it may be to your benefit to slow the divorce down.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because those states of being \"madly in love\" (also known as limerence) have a shelf-life. That euphoria doesn't last a lifetime. By slowing down the divorce you may be able to rescue your marriage because the limerence wears off before the divorce is final.<br /><br />Now Dr. Beam is modifying that statement. He still believes that limerence will erode and that there can be value in slowing the divorce. However, in an effort to slow the divorce, some have done things that provoke their abandoning spouses in ways that aren't beneficial.<br /><br />Yes, Dr. Beam strongly believes that in a divorce you should get an attorney and fight for everything that you need, even if that thwarts your spouse's plans. If your spouse becomes angry, say something such as \"I'm not the one wanting this divorce. I'm happy to work on the marriage if you are. In the meantime, I will follow my attorney's advice and take care of myself and my children. I'm sorry if that upsets you or doesn't give you everything you want, but I must do what I must do if you continue with the divorce.\"<br /><br />There is value in your spouse having to face the consequences of his behavior.<br /><br />However, being unreasonable, mean, or vindictive works against you rather than for you. It antagonizes your spouse without any correlating benefit to your mate or you.<br /><br />So where is the balance?<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Joe Beam and special guest Jim Pourteau talk about protecting yourself during a divorce while not being unfair or unreasonable in ways that only bring about negative consequences.<br /><br />We are <a href=\"http://www.MarriageHelper.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.MarriageHelper.com</a> are for marriages.

            "description": "Who To Listen To When Your Marriage Is In Trouble - The Dr. Joe Show<br /><br />The moment people hear that your marriage is in trouble, you get deluged with every sort of opinion, recommendation, and idea that people can come up with.<br /><br />Most of it is bad.<br /><br />Some of it is motivated by good intentions. However, if the ones who give the advice love you, they most likely aren't very happy with your spouse. Therefore, their viewpoint is skewed against him/her and very much toward protecting you (and maybe toward damaging your spouse).  <br /><br />Others who aren't so close think their advice valid because of something they personally experienced or that they witnessed in another. That's enough for them to make judgments about you, your spouse, and your situation even when they know only a little of what's actually happening. These folks typically are adamant that you heed their counsel, although in reality their advice often is the OPPOSITE of what you should be doing. If you doubt that, post a problem on Facebook telling only the barest of information and watch how many people will tell you EXACTLY what you should do...<br /><br />It's scary...<br /><br />Even professional counselors may lead you astray IF:<br /><br />1) Your situation strikes one of their own emotional chords<br /><br />2) They decide to diagnose your spouse even though they've never met him/her (or had only limited exposure)<br /><br />3) They feel the easiest route to your \"happiness\" is to end the marriage rather than to fight for it<br /><br />So, who do you listen to?<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Joe Beam and special guest Jim Pourteau discuss an actual occurrence on Facebook. Using it as the example, they explain why people tend to think their advice is valid and why you should be very careful about which advice you take. They guide you to sources that truly can help rather than leading you astray.<br /><br />If you're not looking only for people to verify what you WANT to do, but actually seeking help for your marriage problems, listen to this program.<br /><br />Also, check out free resources ranging from articles, eBooks, Podcasts, and more on <a href=\"http://www.MarriageHelper.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.MarriageHelper.com</a>.",

Whatever the cause, you're now trying to make it work again.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />You expect total honesty. You demand that s/he talk about the problem. You want to be understood and you want to understand why s/he did the things s/he did. You thought that reconciling would automatically bring about deep conversations, transparency, accountability, and finally a marriage better than it was before.<br /><br />Are those reasonable expectations? <br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />No.<br /><br />You see, it's all about timing. <br /><br />In this program Dr. Joe Beam and special guest Jim Pourteau discuss that when a couple think they are in reconciliation, many times they are actually in a step before that. No wonder they get frustrated; they're expectations don't match their reality.<br /><br />If you and your spouse are wanting to reconcile - even thinking that you are reconciling - this program will give you insight into what to expect, what NOT to expect, what is okay to demand and which demands may be a deal breaker IF they are made too early.<br /><br />If you wish more information about marriage that you can use, check out the free resources on <a href=\"http://www.MarriageHelper.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.MarriageHelper.com</a>.

He said he wanted them to try to work things out, but he's not quite ready to reconcile.<br /><br />Then he was offered a job in another city. It's lucrative and he accepted. He comes home every weekend to live with his wife and children. They have a great time. He's attentive. The kids love his being there. But then the weekend is over and he heads back.<br /><br />Workable? Maybe. However, there's a catch. During the week, he doesn't call, doesn't take calls, and has no contact whatsoever with his wife or children. <br /><br />They have great weekends. She wonders and worries about what he's doing during the week. It's driving her mad. Is he having another affair? Does he live with some woman over there? What is he doing that prevents him from calling, checking in...or being checked on?<br /><br />She offered an ultimatum of sorts. \"I'll be gone when you come on the weekends. You and the kids have a great time but I can't live with not knowing.\" He told her that if she did that, he would feel pushed away and would give up on the idea of reconciliation.<br /><br />Is he manipulating her? Is there something else going on? What should she do? When should she do it?<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Joe Beam plays the recording of her question and then answers in detail.

She doesn't know if she can ever be happy again.<br /><br />In the first podcast in this two-part series, Dr. Joe Beam brought in his special guest David Mathews, Director of SparkOfLife.Org. David is an expert in helping people deal with loss - any kind of loss, including the death of a loved one. The principles he provided in that podcast \"Life Feels Hopeless After My Spouse Left\" laid the foundation for this program. In this broadcast, David and Dr. Beam discuss practical, doable processes to help her - and you - deal with the loss and find healing for her life.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that she has to give up on her marriage. As Dr. Beam teaches in many podcasts, there is a process that can work to bring back the abandoning spouse and make the marriage good again. Even better than it was. Yet...it isn't a guarantee. It is an amazing process. If anything works, this will work. Three out of four couples who attend Marriage Helper's intensive three-day workshop salvage their marriages and develop them to be better than they were before.<br /><br />Three out of four. But that's not four out of four. <br /><br />The practical information you will hear in this podcast will help you find healing and grow on to a meaningful and fulfilling life whether your spouse comes back or not. <br /><br />It's not magic. It takes work. But the result is again having a life of happiness.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to part one \"Life Feels Hopeless After My Spouse Left,\" we suggest you find that podcast and listen to it first.

He also explains why phone calls usually don't work well either. <br /><br />Then how do you communicate?<br /><br />Dr. Beam shares his simple, yet powerful, \"Triple A Engine\" that turns frustrating conversations into unique interactions that meld two people together. He explains it and illustrates it so you can use it when discussing everything from money...hurt emotions...and even sexual disagreements when one partner wants something the other doesn't want to do.<br /><br />This same \"Triple A Engine\" works with your friends, children, parents, or anyone else with whom you need to communicate on more than a casual level.<br /><br />It is an especially important communication system for romantic love and marriage. If you are in love, want to be in love, or trying to rescue lost love, this system can lead you to levels of understanding, closeness, and intimacy that few people ever reach.<br /><br />For more information about relationships, go to <a href=\"http://www.MarriageHelper.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.MarriageHelper.com</a>.

He explains what the Bible says about sexuality in marriage and points out a specific section that addresses directly the subject of sexual refusal in marriage.<br /><br />Dr. Beam points out to the caller that there may be an underlying problem that led to her not wanting to have sex with him...but that the man is correct that the Bible teaches sexually fulfilling each other. How does a couple resolve those issues? In this program, you'll learn the basic principles as well as how to find further help for making the sexual aspects of your marriage more fulfilling. <br /><br />For more information about marriage - especially marriage problems - check out the many free articles, podcasts, eBooks, and more on <a href=\"http://www.MarriageHelper.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.MarriageHelper.com</a>.<br /><br />To ask Dr. Beam your question, you may record it at <a href=\"http://www.SpeakPipe.com/JoeBeam\" rel=\"noopener\">www.SpeakPipe.com/JoeBeam</a>.

She mentioned that she had prayed about what she was to do and in response God \"told\" her to divorce her husband and be with her lover...that He had sent her this lover and wanted her to be with him.<br /><br />She talked about how she had quit interacting with Christian people because they were mean and judgmental about her leaving her husband for another. She feels complete confidence that God answered her prayer for a wonderful marriage by providing the right man for a new marriage.<br /><br />Yes, she had slept with her lover, but God was fine with that also. \"God is love. I feel love for him. Therefore, this is of God.\"<br /><br />Is it?<br /><br />In this program Dr. Joe Beam discusses whether God sends people lovers to replace their spouses. Dr. Beam usually approaches relationship questions from his educational and social science background. When he speaks, he refers to solid research as he gives relevant examples and replies to specific questions. However, because of this topic (and the questions he continues to receive about it) in this program he refers to Scripture. (Dr. Beam's Bachelor's degree is in Bible. He has more than 30 graduate hours in Bible.) He does give relevant examples, but he also reads verses and ask the listener to consider what they really say.<br /><br />If you are a Christian and in love with someone other than your spouse...or your Christian spouse is in love with someone other than you, this program will be a fascinating Bible study for you that can bring you peace.",

But we aren't children and we don't want our husbands or wives telling us what we must do, think, say, or feel to keep from being chastised or punished...or abandoned.<br /><br />I want...and deserve...a partner with whom I can have union based on love, NOT a relationship based on making him or her happy by yielding to nearly every way s/he thinks things should be done.<br /><br />In our work with marriages, we found that one of the most common reasons for major marital discord is a spouse who feels controlled, disrespected, or dominated by the other. Interestingly, often the dominating spouse doesn't believe s/he is being controlling.<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Joe Beam and Kimberly Holmes, CEO of Marriage Helper, explain why people control others and how they do it. More importantly, they explain how a person being controlled can put an end to that WITHOUT putting an end to the marriage. It won't stop on its own, but it can be stopped when the controlled spouse knows what to do.<br /><br />During the program Dr. Beam and Ms. Holmes offer free access to this free eBook about control.

How many were about wanting to be loved, enjoying amazing love, or longing for lost love? Why those topics? Because most adults fit into one of those three categories. Some wonder where their lover may come from...if at all. Others hope the one they secretly love will finally come to realize it and respond with passion. Many bask in the deep emotions of shared love...and think it will be like this forever. And way too many still love the person who once loved them but now is gone...<br /><br />So what is love really?<br /><br />Is it the ecstatic emotion of new romance? Is it the security of trusting the person you love to always love you in return? Is it something that really does last a lifetime or is it fleeting...lasting a few years at best?<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Joe Beam responds to your questions about love. What it is. How to know if you really are in love. How long it lasts. When it ends. Why it ends. Can it last a lifetime?<br /><br />And, maybe most important to many, if it has ended can it be rekindled?<br /><br />The program begins at 9 p.m. (Central), March 22, 2016.

            "description": "Great marriages have great sex.<br /><br />Not just sex.<br /><br />Not just good sex.<br /><br />Great sex!<br /><br />As Dr. Beam earned his PhD through the University of Sydney (rated one of the top 50 universities in the world), he concentrated his research on the correlations between sexual satisfaction and marital satisfaction. Many scholarly studies agree that they rise or fall together. Want a great relationship, have great sex. Want great sex, have a great relationship.<br /><br />In this program Dr. Beam focuses on research about the difference between good sex and great sex. Very interesting research identified eight factors of great sex. Dr. Beam will explain each of them. He teaches this methodology for great sex every semester in his human sexuality class at one of Nashville's leading universities.

            "description": "Great marriages have great sex.<br /><br />Not just sex.<br /><br />Not just good sex.<br /><br />Great sex!<br /><br />As Dr. Beam earned his PhD through the University of Sydney (rated one of the top 50 universities in the world), he concentrated his research on the correlations between sexual satisfaction and marital satisfaction. Many scholarly studies agree that they rise or fall together. Want a great relationship, have great sex. Want great sex, have a great relationship.<br /><br />In this program Dr. Beam focuses on research about the difference between good sex and great sex. Very interesting research identified eight factors of great sex. Dr. Beam will explain each of them. He teaches this methodology for great sex every semester in his human sexuality class at one of Nashville's leading universities. Now he shares them with you.<br /><br />Dr. Beam invites your calls during the program to ask questions, make comments, seek clarification, or disagree.

            "description": "Have you ever prayed about love? Perhaps something that you wanted to happen. Maybe something you didn't want to happen.<br /><br />It might have been about a specific person, either someone you already have a relationship or marriage with or that you want a relationship or marriage with. It might have been about a specific situation...something that you have a strong desire to have...or to avoid.<br /><br />From a multitude of postings found on Facebook to thousands of conversations over the years, Dr. Joe Beam has chosen three of the prayers people mention that - no matter how much they believe they will be - are not going to be answered by God.<br /><br />Although his PhD is not in any religious area of study - his graduate work is about the psychology and emotions of love, sex, and marriage - he has a degree in Bible. That doesn't make him a theologian, but it does make him a student of the teachings of God.<br /><br />No, Dr. Beam doesn't claim to speak for God. Yet, he's convinced that some of what is claimed about how God intervenes in the love and relationships of people leads only to false hope...and, eventually, disappointment.<br /><br />If you're curious, he's a believer. He prays. He believes God answers prayers...but not all prayers.

            "description": "Have you ever prayed about love? Perhaps something that you wanted to happen. Maybe something you didn't want to happen.<br /><br />It might have been about a specific person, either someone you already have a relationship or marriage with or that you want a relationship or marriage with. It might have been about a specific situation...something that you have a strong desire to have...or to avoid.<br /><br />From a multitude of postings found on Facebook to thousands of conversations over the years, Dr. Joe Beam has chosen three of the prayers people mention that - no matter how much they believe they will be - are not going to be answered by God.<br /><br />Although his PhD is not in any religious area of study - his graduate work is about the psychology and emotions of love, sex, and marriage - he has a degree in Bible. That doesn't make him a theologian, but it does make him a student of the teachings of God.<br /><br />No, Dr. Beam doesn't claim to speak for God. Yet, he's convinced that some of what is claimed about how God intervenes in the love and relationships of people leads only to false hope...and, eventually, disappointment.<br /><br />If you're curious, he's a believer. He prays. He believes God answers prayers...but not all prayers. Especially some that people pray about love and relationships.<br /><br />Is this a program to take away hope?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />It is a program about how to have hope that is real; that is possible. To live by genuine faith if you have faith.

            "description": "You've done something that you know will hurt your spouse if s/he knew about it. Maybe it was recent? Maybe years ago? Maybe even before you met, but you have worry that s/he will react badly if it came out.<br /><br />Do you tell? <br /><br />Do you keep it a secret?<br /><br />If you do tell, will it end your marriage...or at the very least cause hard and angry feelings that will last for a long time?<br /><br />If you don't tell, will it erode your marriage from within because of how it affects you to keep it secret?<br /><br />And if you were to tell, WHAT should you tell and what should you leave OUT?<br /><br />In this program, Dr. Beam gives clear and understandable guidelines for deciding whether to tell or not to tell. That's right; in some situations it is far better NOT to tell. For others, the marriage is in jeopardy UNTIL you tell. The principles and guidelines presented in this program will help you decide. And if you decide you should tell, Dr. Beam gives principles of what TO tell and what NOT to tell.<br /><br />If you wish to ask Dr. Beam about a specific situation, call during the program to (646) 378-0424 to speak with him live.<br /><br />Don't live in miserable hesitation any longer about whether to tell your spouse. Find peace by knowing whether to tell and, if so, what to tell. Don't miss this episode of Marriage Radio with Joe Beam...the Dr. Joe Show.",

They informed their kids. They made their plans for separate lives. <br /><br />But things changed.<br /><br />Against apparently impossible odds, he called her and asked if she would consider working things out. She agreed.<br /><br />It wasn't all easy. There was work to do. She understood his need to grieve losing the other relationship. He understood her need to work through their issues. Together, they did it. Today they have a good, solid loving marriage.<br /><br />During this program, Dr. Joe Beam will ask them questions to lead them through their story...but not just the story. He will ask how the wife could be strong enough to understand her husband's grieving losing what he had with the other woman. He will ask them how their children reacted to being told their marriage was going to end...and how they reacted when they realized their parents were going to make their marriage work. There will be several questions that the couple will answer honestly and forthrightly. However, you, too, can ask specific questions.

Your attorney counsels going for everything you can get. Your own hurt and anger tempt you to make this divorce a most miserable experience for your spouse.<br /><br />BUT your spouse says you're selfish, that your standing strong is just another example of you trying to control him/her, and that everything you are doing is definitive proof that s/he can't live with you and that divorce is the best thing that can happen.<br /><br />You find yourself worrying whether you should give in to most of his/her demands. You wonder if your standing strong and fighting for your marriage is building such anger and resentment in your spouse that never will there ever be a chance for reconciliation. You even have doubts about your own motives and fear that s/he is right and that you are a mean, selfish person and that the way you're standing strong actually proves that to be true.<br /><br />Would you like to know?

When they vacate or violate the LovePath, they fall out of love whether they mean to or not.<br /><br />Is there a way to keep on the LovePath? To keep falling in love over a lifetime? <br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />In this program Joe Beam and Kimberly Beam Holmes explain the first step on the LovePath...the step that many people forget over time and, as a result, either start falling out of love with their spouses OR their spouses start falling out of love with them. <br /><br />Some have gone further than that. They are not at the \"starting\" point of falling out of love. Love is dead. (Either their's or their spouse's love.)<br /><br />By understanding this first phase of falling in love...and how to use it over your entire lifetime...you can stay in love...and even RENEW LOST LOVE.<br /><br />As we discuss this first phase of the LovePath, we will take your calls to demonstrate how the LovePath works in your life by answering your real-life questions.

Another 15% are in the \"low sex\" category, which means they have sex with each other 11 to 25 times per year. That means 35% (or we can just round that to one out of three) married American couples between the ages of 18 and 59 make love to each other twice a month or less, and the majority of those are once a month or less.<br /><br />Notice that these aren't folks in the nursing home.<br /><br />Does making love this little have an effect on a marriage? On sexual health? On potential affairs? On  use?<br /><br />Yes to all of the above.<br /><br />In this program, Joe Beam discusses how sex in a marriage is directly affected by the relationship the couple have. More than that, he discusses how to increase both the frequency of lovemaking and the enjoyment that both husband and wife can gain from it.<br /><br />For those couples where one spouse wants to do something sexually that the other is resistant to do, he offers practical advice about how to solve that problem to the satisfaction (emotionally and sexually) of both spouses.<br /><br />He also reveals the secret to changing bad sex (or even good sex) to GREAT sex.<br /><br />Call in to talk with Joe about specific questions you have about lovemaking, anatomy, or anything you wish to learn.
