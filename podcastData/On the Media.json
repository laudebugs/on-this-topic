Completed in 1973, its architect, Minoru Yamasaki, hoped the towers would stand as “a representation of man’s belief in humanity</span><span>” and “world peace.” He even took inspiration from the Great Mosque in the holy city of Mecca with its tall minarets looking down on a sprawling plaza. What he did not expect was that the buildings would become a symbol to some of American imperialism and the strangling grip of global capitalism.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Our story picks up in Manila — January 6th, 1995 — where police respond to an apartment fire and uncover a plot to assassinate the Pope. A suspect gives up his boss in the scheme: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Yousef has been on the run for two years and has disappeared again. Port Authority Detective Matthew Besheer and FBI Special Agent Frank Pellegrino fly to Manila to follow his trail. They learn that Yousef has a horrifying attack in the works involving bombs on a dozen airplanes, rigged to explode simultaneously. President Bill Clinton grounds all U.S. flights from the Pacific as the era of enhanced airline security begins. Yousef’s plot is foiled.

This week we want to introduce you to a new podcast a <span>co-production of HISTORY and WNYC </span>hosted by reporter, Jim O'Grady. Blindspot: Road to 9/11 is an eight part series that uses the voices of U.S. government and intelligence officials, national security experts, reporters, informants, and associates of the terrorists to tell the little-known story of the lead up to the events of September 11th 2001.</p>\r\n<p>This is episode one: The Bullet. The 9/11 attacks were so much more than a bolt from the blue on a crisp September morning. They were more than a decade in the making. The story starts in a Midtown Manhattan hotel ballroom in 1990. Shots ring out and the extremist rabbi, Meir Kahane, lies mortally wounded. His assassin, El-Sayyid Nosair, is connected to members of a Brooklyn mosque who are training to fight with Islamic freedom fighters in Afghanistan. NYPD Detective Louis Napoli and FBI Special Agent John Anticev catch the case, and start unraveling a conspiracy that is taking place in plain sight by blending into the tumult of the city. It is animated by an emerging ideology: violent jihad.</p>\r\n<p>Listen wherever you get your podcasts. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n",

On the other, progressive think piece writers saying cancel culture is blown way out of proportion, and is really just powerful people <em>finally</em><span> </span>being held accountable for their actions. But according to YouTuber Natalie Wynn, creator of the channel<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvsIonJdJ5E4EXMa65VYpA\">ContraPoints</a>, neither of these argument is quite correct.</span></p>\r\n<p>Wynn herself has been canceled. Many times over. For a host of offenses. <span>And it’s given her plenty of time to reflect on all the ways the dominant conversations around cancel culture miss the particular pernicious effects of the phenomenon. In her video, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjMPJVmXxV8\">Canceling</a>,\" she takes an honest look at her own cancellations and its effects, and outlines a set of principles around cancel culture to help clarify what, exactly, it is — and what it can lead to. In this conversation, Wynn breaks those principles down for Brooke.</span></p>\r\n<p><em>This is a longer version of an interview that originally in our January 31st, 2020 program, <em>“Cancel This!”</em></em></p>\r\n",

Later, there was the Great Migration, in which millions of African Americans fled north, where governments, lenders, and white neighbors would never let them own their land and build their own wealth. And now a system, purpose-built, extracts what it can, turning black and brown renters into debtors and evictees. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In this excerpt from our series, The Scarlet E: Unmasking America’s Eviction Crisis, we catalog the thefts and the schemes — most of which were perfectly legal — and we ask how long this debt will fester.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Matthew Desmond, founder of<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://evictionlab.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>The Eviction Lab</span></a><span><span> </span>and our partner in this series, and Marty Wegbreit, director of litigation for the<span> </span></span><a href=\"http://cvlas.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Central Virginia Legal Aid Society</span></a><span>, point us toward the legal and historical developments that evolved into the present crisis.

Therefore, to invite conservative writers who truly articulated Trump's views to readers would mean inviting a strain of authoritarianism and illiberalism that would never actually be welcome in its opinion pages. Instead, they invite relatively palatable conservatives who make irrelevant arguments about politics. It's a losing game.</p>\r\n<p>Last week, however, the paper invited Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">write an opinion piece</a> arguing for the military to be sent to American streets to \"restore order.\" Former <em>Times</em> opinion editor James Bennet (who has since resigned) also admitted that he had not read it before it was published. So, what does this latest episode tell us about the media's role in upholding America's values? <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21281309/new-york-times-op-ed-editor-tom-cotton-is-trump-authoritarian\">This week, David Roberts once again wrote about the Times opinion section for Vox</a>, in a post arguing that the Cotton op-ed \"revealed a pathology on the editorial side... an insistence on extending the presumption of good faith to the GOP, even in the face of its rising authoritarianism.\"</p>\r\n",

When he brandished a Bible before photographers, Trump knew exactly what message he was sending: Christianity is under siege and the president is the defender of the faith. Never mind the fact that peaceful protesters, clergy among them, were driven from the area minutes before with tear gas to make way for the photoshoot.</p>\r\n<p>The narrative of Christianity under attack is a familiar one. Just a few weeks ago, Trump declared that houses of worship should open amid the pandemic on the grounds of religious liberty — despite the public health risk. But it turns out, the myth of Christian persecution can be traced far further back than the Culture Wars.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, according to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/candidamoss\"> Candida Moss</a>, Christian historians coined the idea that to be persecuted was to be righteous in the 4th Century and they exaggerated claims that Christians were persecuted in the first place. Moss is a professor of theology and religion at Birmingham University in the U.K., and author of <em>The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom. </em>Moss spoke to Bob just after Trump has announced his call for churches to open. In this week's Pod Extra she explains how Christian history has been revised for political means, from the early church to present day.</p>\r\n",

Fires have been raging since September and a prolonged drought and record-breaking temperatures mean the blazes won't stop for weeks — if not months. </p>\r\n<p>But to read or watch or listen to the conservative press in Australia is to get an altogether different story: that it's arson, not climate change, that's mainly responsible for the deaths of nearly 30 humans and an estimated one billion animals.

Wade</span></em><span> was by far the most familiar, with 40 percent able to name it. (Only five percent could name </span><em><span>Brown v. Board of Education.</span></em><span>) And since it was decided in 1973, a majority — roughly 70 percent — have consistently said they want <em>Roe</em> upheld, albeit with some restrictions on legal abortion. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>But what do we really know about <em>Roe</em>? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has often said she wishes it had been another case that the Supreme Court heard as the first reproductive freedom case instead. It was </span><em><span>Susan Struck v. Secretary of Defense</span></em><span>, and it came to the high court during the same term as </span><em><span>Roe</span></em><span>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The year was 1970, and the Air Force (like the other branches of the military) had a regulation banning female service members from having a family. If a servicewoman got pregnant, she would get discharged. Captain Susan Struck was a nurse serving in Vietnam, and she challenged the decision in court with Ginsburg as her lawyer. However, the court never heard the case because the Air Force changed their policy first. For this week's show, we partnered with The Guardian (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/13/us-air-force-pregnancy-susan-struck-abortion-motherhood-america\">read their story here</a>) to learn more about Susan Struck’s fight and its bigger lessons for reproductive freedom and for women in the workplace. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Our producer Alana Casanova-Burgess and<span> </span></span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-glenza\"><span>The Guardian's health reporter Jessica Glenza</span></a><span><span> </span>spoke to Struck about the difficult decision she made to give her baby up for adoption in order to fight the regulation.

Bob is one of the Purple Project organizers.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>Democracy is in trouble. Not necessarily because of our current political mayhem, or even because of the accumulated sins and failures of American society, but because vast swaths of the public are giving up on the system that has governed us for 243 years.</span></p>\r\n<p>Here are some alarming data points: One, in 2018 only 33% of the general population expressed trust for government. Two, among 1400 adults asked about the importance of democracy, only 39% of younger participants said “absolutely important.” <span>Three, in a <a href=\"https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/follow-the-leader\">2018 Democracy Fund surve</a>y of 5000 Americans, 24% of respondents expressed support for “a strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with Congress or elections,” and either a “strong leader” and 18% for “army rule.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The more complicated question is what as a society we are to do about it? In this mini-series we’ll be talking that over, but we’ll begin with the actual state of public sentiment and public participation. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericpliu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Eric Liu</a> is the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/citizenuniv?lang=en\">Citizen University</a> and Co-chair of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship.
