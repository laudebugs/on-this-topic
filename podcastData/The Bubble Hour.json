    "description": "The Bubble Hour is hosted by Jean M., a sober woman dedicated to breaking down the walls of stigma and denial surrounding the disease of alcoholism.\n\nAlcoholism effects more than 50% of American adults, either directly or indirectly, and yet it still remains a \"taboo\" topic and is still mostly misunderstood by the majority of people (even those effected by alcoholism and their loved ones).\n\nThe Bubble Hour seeks to inform, educate and help people identify with the stories they hear, the conversations and interviews with people who are just like they are, and let people know they aren't alone. Nobody can take the first tentative steps towards sobriety without first getting past denial, but even once they are past denial the stigma surrounding alcoholism is so strong that people are reluctant to seek help.\n\nThe Bubble Hour would like to change that stigma. Jean and the vibrant community of sober people who join her here, will be recording and offering this show for anyone to listen to for information, community, empathy and understanding.\n\nWe are so grateful for the sober people who came before us to help find this path; this is one way to give back.\n\nPlease help us spread the word about this website and the pod casts; you may be helping someone you know well but don't even know they have a problem.\n\nAlcoholism thrives in the dark.  Together, we bring light.  And hope.",

            "description": "A must-listen episode for anyone struggling to understand chronic relapse.\r\n\r\nErica C. Barnett had her first sip of alcohol when she was thirteen, and she quickly developed a taste for drinking to oblivion with her friends. In her late twenties, her addiction became inescapable. Volatile relationships, blackouts, and unsuccessful stints in detox defined her life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time she was in her late thirties, Erica Barnett had run the gauntlet of alcoholism. She had recovered and relapsed time and again, but after each new program or detox center would find herself far from rehabilitated. “Rock bottom,” Barnett writes, “is a lie.” It is always possible, she learned, to go lower than your lowest point. She found that the terms other alcoholics used to describe the trajectory of their addiction–“rock bottom” and “moment of clarity”–and the mottos touted by Alcoholics Anonymous, such as “let go and let God” and “you’re only as sick as your secrets”–didn’t correspond to her experience and could actually be detrimental.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith remarkably brave and vulnerable writing, Barnett expands on her personal story to confront the dire state of addiction in America, the rise of alcoholism in American women in the last century, and the lack of rehabilitation options available to addicts. At a time when opioid addiction is a national epidemic and one in twelve Americans suffers from alcohol abuse disorder, Quitter is essential reading for our age and an ultimately hopeful story of Barnett’s own hard-fought path to sobriety.\r\n\r\nHost Jean McCarthy's blog UnPickled is at www.unpickledblog.com.

But one day she felt a desire to escape rising within her, and she answered it by allowing her daughters a rare morning of cartoons and cereals as she added wine to her orange juice. It seemed to come out of nowhere, this desire for alcohol, but it helped. \r\n\r\nIn time, Wanja learned that the need to escape was stemming from the pain of past events, long buried and disregarded.\r\n\r\nToday, Wanja lives her life in connection with herself and her gifts.

Despite attending a program and doing stepwork, she was easily dissuaded from an alcohol-free lifestyle and continued to drink through her 30s and 40s. Her alcohol use escalated when she became a parent, as she struggled with feelings of guilt and shame over not enjoying motherhood as much as she felt she \"should'. Eventually Michellene realized that she didn't need to hit a low bottom to change her relationship with alcohol and she decided on January 1, 2017 to leave it behind for good.\r\n",

When her children grew and everything changed, she recognized a need to focus on her own life and attend to nuturing her sobriety and recovery. In time, the two threads became woven together and Kelly now combines education and recovery to help other women learn to take back their power and thrive without alcohol and other problematic forms of coping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKelly pursued Karuna Training, a contemplative psychology program, and has now moved into the graduate stream. She is a She Recovers Recovery Coach, one of only 3 to receive the prestigious \"Signature\" designation, and is the administrator of the SheRecovers Together online group, a private support group with over 2000 members. Kelly operates Shining Bright Recovery, where she helps women from around the world take charge of their recovery through coaching and personal support. Kelly also organizes and facilitates a monthly SheRecovers Sharing Circle in Seattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOn a personal note, Kelly's life took an intresting turn on a vacation overseas, where - no kidding - a handsome windmill owner stole her heart.

            "description": "On this episode we will talk about those moments in recovery when we realize we're doing something (or feeling something) that used to make us want to drink, and yet here we are able to do them sober. Along with special guest, Author Dana Bowman, we will talk about what these moments were like for us when we drank, in early recovery, and what they are like for us now. \r\n\r\nLots of people, when contemplating getting sober, think: \"But what about that vacation/wedding/holiday? How will I get through that sober?\" It's not always the big events, though, that can be difficult to navigate; sometimes it's just a long, boring day, or a disappointment, or even when things are going really well, that make us think about a drink. Before we get sober, or in early recovery (or heck, sometimes even well into recovery) it can feel like we can't make it through these thoughts/feelings/moments without a drink, an escape or a way to numb. The good news is that in recovery there are so many ways to not only survive these things, but actually learn and grow in life-changing ways.\r\n\r\nDana Bowman is an author and speaker who lives in a sweet small town in the Midwest. She has been published in substance.com, The After Party Magazine, The Fix, and others, and is the proud author at Momsieblog.com. Her book, Bottled: How to Survive Early Recovery, published by Central Recovery Press, is now available on amazon.com and at bookstores.\r\n",

            "description": "Setting boundaries is an essential skill in life, especially for people in recovery. Alcoholic and addicts often have dysfunctional boundaries: either too rigid (leading to suppressed emotions or distant relationships) or too enmeshed (depriving us of a sense of personal identity). If we don't learn how to create and maintain healthy boundaries interpersonal relationships may continue to be defined by old roles and patterns, increasing the risk of relapse.\r\n\r\nAs part of recovery, we learn how to set boundaries and to respect other people’s boundaries in return. \r\n\r\nBut, especially in early recovery, this can be daunting.  An important aspect of setting healthy boundaries is learning, simply, how to say \"no\".  Another important part of setting boundaries is identifying how we are feeling; something that can take practice when we are newly sober. We can't teach other people how to treat us if we can't identify our own thoughts, feelings and emotions.\r\n\r\nOn this show we will discuss what boundaries are, why they are important, and share tips, tools and advice on ways we identify, build and strengthen them, with an emphasis on how to do this when you are newly sober.\r\n",

We may try to cover up our drinking and tell lies or exaggerations to avoid consequences, responsibility, or conflict. Dishonesty is at the root of denial including telling ourselves we can safely drink when we have evidence to the contrary. Lying may even become a habit as we hide from our addiction to cover up our true mental and emotional health to protect our ego, reputation, self image.\r\n\r\nChoosing sobriety may be the first truly honest thing we've done in awhile. On this episode, we talk about how honesty has shaped our recovery, the choices we have to make to get and stay sober, how our definitions of honesty have evolved, and how dishonesty figures into the 11 stages of relapse if we let it.\r\n",

There is a saying in recovery rooms which states, “Addiction is the only disease that tells you that you are alright.”, so when we isolate, we are putting our recovery at risk.\r\n\r\nOn this episode of The Bubble Hour we discuss the issue of isolation with Andrea Owen, certified life coach and author of “52 Ways to Live a Kick-Ass Life”.\r\n",

There is the fear that you’ll be “found out,\" which may lead you to attempt to work longer and harder than others. This can be a source of resentment, exhaustion, and a sense of impending doom. While Impostor Syndrome is not solely the domain of alcoholics, many of us report deep attachments to perfectionism and, it's cousin, Impostor Syndrome. Many of us drank over our feelings of resentment and fear arising from the core belief that we were frauds. Now that we are sober, we can bring these fears into the light of truth. When we think, \"I'm a fraud,\" instead of drinking, we ask, \"Is that true?\" We connect with our recovery communities and see the truth of our own self-worth reflected back at us in the faces of our sober friends. We learn to discard these old patterns of thinking and replace them with healthier, more balanced ones. In recovery, we find freedom from the tyranny of Impostor Syndrome.\r\n",

Because the symptoms of the disease of addiction are behavioral as well as physical, and denial is such a huge component of the disease as well, it is difficult (if not impossible) to reason with an active alcoholic/addict.  Many people turn to an intervention to get help for an addict who is not able to break the cycle of addiction.  \r\n\r\nBut where to start?  On this episode we will walk through the steps of an intervention, as well as provide advice on what works, and what doesn't.  We will talk about ways a family can be helpful to an active addict, both with an intervention and in general, share our own personal experiences with interventions, and talk to a nationally certified recovery coach.\r\n\r\nPlease tune in to this informative episode!  \r\n",

            "description": " Getting sober is not easy and many say the first 90 days are critical. This is a time when we are learning a whole new way of life and it can be very difficult and confusing. Celebrating milestones, whether it’s 24 hours, 30, 60, 90 days or years, helps us to see how far we have come and re-commit staying sober. Most recovery programs celebrate milestones by giving out a token (chip, keychain, etc.). This is helpful to the recipient and to others members of the group to see that long-term sobriety is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOn this episode of The Bubble Hour, we will talk about how celebrating milestones has helped us with our recovery and some of the special things we have done to celebrate.  \r\n",

I can go weeks without a drink,\" but we still have a sneaking suspicion that something is wrong and can't quite figure out how to break the habit. Or we get some sober time - 30, 60, 90 days or more - and then think, \"Surely I have figured out to moderate by now!\" We cycle through dark thoughts of shame and defiance to willingness mixed with confusion.

Others find living without alcohol and drugs to be a struggle every day. Regardless of your experience, we are all susceptible to triggers which can cause us to relapse. Recognizing and managing these triggers is important to maintaining our sobriety.\r\n\r\nSo what are triggers? A “trigger” of addiction involves any high-risk situation or stressor that “cues” a thought, feeling, or action to use alcohol or drugs. There are two types of triggers: internal, which occur within us, and external which occurs outside of us. \r\n\r\nOn this episode we will explore common triggers and discuss ways to counteract these unhealthy reactions and develop an action plan to keep ourselves safe and sober. \r\n",

It’s impossible to avoid, and while shame is painful and can keep many of us stuck in the throes of addiction, there is hope.  We do not have to be defined by our shame, and indeed learning tools to cope with shame and learn and grow as people is an integral part of recovery.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, though, it’s important to define shame.  One way to do this is to clarify the difference between shame and guilt.  Guilt is feeling badly about something we’ve done, and shame is feeling badly about who we are.   Guilt is based on actions, and shame is built on feelings.  Another way to put it is this:   When we feel guilty we feel we made a mistake.  When we feel shame we feel we are a mistake.\r\n\r\nIn this show, we will talk about building tools to identify shame, build awareness of it, talk about the importance of reaching out to reduce the power shame holds over you, and discuss the power of story and voice in reducing and even eliminating the hold shame has in your life.\r\n",

            "description": "Most people are aware that alcoholics, whether they are heavy drinkers or not, will experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, both physical and emotional, when they first get sober. Some of the more obvious signs of this “acute” or early withdrawal include: shaking, sweating, racing heartbeat, muscle twitches, insomnia and acute anxiety. These symptoms are mostly physical and may last as long as 2 weeks, but we are prepared for them and if we stay sober, most people think it will be smooth sailing going forward. It is true that people may feel better after the first couple of weeks, however it is the sobriety–based symptoms, known as Post-Acute Withdrawal (PAWs) that cause many people to relapse. PAWs may last as long as 2 years, so understanding what it is and learning ways to manage these symptoms is critical to maintaining long-term sobriety. On this episode of The Bubble Hour we will discuss these symptoms are share ways to deal with and relieve the effect of PAWS. Whether you’re just getting sober or have been sober for a while, this is a very important show for YOU. \r\n",

Statistics are thrown around –both for and against – but what does the science say?  How effective are these programs?\r\n\r\nOn this episode, we are honored to have Dr. John F. Kelly as our guest.  Dr. Kelly is the Elizabeth R. Spallin Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, the founder and Director of the Recovery Research Institute at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the Program Director of the Addiction Recovery Management Service (ARMS) and the Associate Director of the Center for Addiction Medicine at MGH.\r\n\r\nDr. Kelly will discuss with us how 12 Step recovery groups impact an individual’s recovery from a scientific perspective.   How well do these programs work?  Is there a difference in their effectiveness for early versus long-term recovery?  Are they more effective following a treatment program?  What studies have been done to demonstrate “success” rates of 12 step group members, and how exactly is “success” defined in this environment?\r\n\r\nIf you participate in a 12 Step recovery program, are considering participating or believe they don’t work but are curious to learn more, this show is for you.  \r\n\r\n \r\n",

            "description": "When we find we have the desire to stop drinking, we may have the urge to get sober alone. \"I can do this by myself\" is a common refrain in early recovery. But the solo route is a difficult trek through the thickets of recovery. At worst, it may set us up for relapse; at best, it's a lonely row to hoe. Connection with other sober people creates a safe landing place where we can wiggle out of isolation and fear and into a community where we are loved and supported. Building a network of sober friends is one of the great joys of recovery. Community helps us stay sober, as we learn from each other: we learn about the disease of alcoholism, about how to stay sober, about being of service. On this episode of The Bubble Hour, we talk about how to build and belong to a sober network - from the \"new kid\" jitters, to the anniversary celebrations, to the gifts of sober meet-ups. Join our podcast community, and let's stay sober together!\r\n",

In fact, the dictionary defines desperation as, “a strong feeling of sadness, fear, and loss of hope”. But as with so many other things in recovery, like surrender, vulnerability and powerlessness, desperation has an opposite meaning.\r\n\r\nTaking that first step in stopping drinking is extremely difficult for most of us. We can’t even begin to imagine how to live our lives without alcohol…until we become desperate. When we are in enough pain, when we become desperate...we make a change. We surrender. We ask for help. This is why we call it, “The Gift of Desperation”.\r\n\r\nOn this episode we will discuss what the gift of desperation felt like for us and how we use that same gift as a tool in maintaining our sobriety.\r\n",

            "description": "\"Looking back, we see that our freedom to choose badly was not, after all, a very real freedom.\"*\r\n\r\nWhen we romanticize our drinking days, we may feel like they were carefree and we had the freedom to do as we pleased. We liked doing things our way (and we don’t like being told what to do!). Then again....on further reflection, we remember that alcohol didn’t leave us with many choices - no matter how hard we tried, no matter our best intentions, and no matter the consequences, it always called us back. It left us with shame and sadness. And, we see now, drinking was either at the root of or exacerbated all of our problems!\r\n\r\nIn sobriety, we come to find that life is for living, not enduring! We are no longer burdened with “feeding the beast,” which leaves room for a full life. We make authentic connections with our true selves and with others. We have clear sight about how to show up for our lives, without fear! In recovery, we find freedom!\r\n\r\n*reference: The Grapevine, May 1960\r\n",

Eventually, the “firsts” are fewer and further between, but their infrequency can make them feel more jarring. On this episode of The Bubble Hour we look at “sober firsts” of three major types:\r\n“Mixing with the Normies” – going back to the places and situations where drinking is part of the milieu, now as a person in recovery“Engaging in Recovery” – new places and situations you encounter once you quit drinking“Sober and Solo” – the things you go to or through on your own.\r\nJoin us and our guests as we talk about what these experiences were like for us and some tips for navigating these challenges of early sobriety. \r\n\r\nWe had so much to talk about on this show we couldn't get to it all, so stay tuned for Part 2!\r\n",

Do you feel a sense of responsibility for your loved one's happiness? If any of these questions ring true for you, you may be a codependent.\r\n\r\nCodependency is an emotional behavior that affects our ability to have healthy, mutually-satisfying relationships. It is often found in individuals who are in a relationship with an addicted person or someone with a mental illness. Codependents often have low self-esteem and look for anything outside of themselves to make them feel better…including drugs and alcohol or other compulsive behaviors so you can see why this is an important topic for us to understand and address.\r\n\r\nOn this episode of The Bubble Hour we will dig into the nature of a codependency and discuss how we can “detach with love” so that we can enjoy healthy, happy relationships with our loved ones.\r\n",

I am the most unlikely alcoholic ever.” In fact, alcoholics share many common personality traits, and surprisingly that includes perfectionism.

Our egos say, “I am responsible for your survival.  Trust me.  I’m in control.”  \r\n\r\nThis is our best thinking.  \r\n\r\nWe hang on to it even though our Egos can lead us to feel angry, resentful, defensive, frightened.  Or completely alone and fraudulent, afraid that people will find out who we really are at our core.  We scramble to maintain the image that we’re in control.  We want to do things our way, on our own steam.  We are still cautious about letting people in.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thinking can persist even in sobriety and can present a danger to our recovery.  Join us as we talk about how Ego-thinking contributed to our drinking and disturbed our peace of mind, and how connection, compassion, and authenticity  brought us serenity and keeps us sober.\r\n",

It's not fun, but most people expect it and are rewarded with immediate physical benefits once the alcohol or drug is purged from their system. Our lives begin to improve and we are happy, BUT then there are other things that seem to be getting worse - mood swings, anxiety, irregular sleep, etc. - and we want to scream, \"I did NOT get sober for this!\"  \r\n\r\nThe good news and bad news is this is completely normal. What we are experiencing is called PAWS or Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, which feels like an emotional roller coaster. PAWS can be very difficult to deal with and is a huge trigger for relapse, but drinking will only make the process start all over again and who wants to do that?!!!  So how do we get through it? How do  we manage the roller coaster ride of early sobriety? \r\n\r\nJoin us on this episode of The Bubble Hour as we talk to our guests about their experience with early sobriety and the tools they used to alleviate PAWS symptoms. \r\n",

            "description": "The earliest stages of recovery are marked by an inkling that something needs to change, and a budding curiosity emerges to ask such questions as: “What is normal drinking?” “How much is too much?” “Am I an alcoholic?” And “how do I quit drinking?” From behind the safety of our computers screens we pose the uncertainties that trouble our souls, seeking information and all that comes with it: guidance, comfort, direction, and hope. So it is that many stumble upon the frank world of sobriety bloggers: others in recovery who chronicle the ups and downs of their own personal journeys, sharing the experience as both an exercise in healing and in service to others. Join us as we speak to the authors of four popular recovery blogs: Mrs D is Going Without, Bye Bye Beer and UnPickled.\r\n",

A man with a bottle under a bridge?...A woman with smeared lipstick who drinks every day, can't hold a job and doesn't take care of her kids? Unfortunately, our society has created this stigma for alcoholics and it's simply NOT true.  There are more people like us than not, but many people don't get help because of this stigma and they are dying. \r\n\r\nOn this episode of The Bubble Hour we will be talking to our very special guest AnnMarie McCullough, co-founder of Faces & Voices of Recovery Canada, about what the face of an alcoholic really looks like and why it's so important that we change the way society treats this disease. \r\n\r\nRecovery advocate Ann Marie McCullough is a maven of reinvention with a serious social conscience and a need to give back. A certified Project Manager with over 20 years experience in a variety of roles within the Healthcare and IT sectors, she now works as the Director of Communications and Community Relations at the Orchard Recovery Center.  AnnMarie combined her background in project and event management with her passion for recovery to help launch the REEL Recovery Film Festival in Vancouver and initiate the first RECOVERY DAY in Canada. Her latest projects: co-hosting Vancouver's first Recovery Radio show and co-founding Faces and Voices of Recovery Canada.\r\n\r\nIn long-term recovery herself since 2008, she inspires with her energy and enthusiasm, embodying hope for others who struggle with addiction.\r\n",

            "description": "Did you grow up in a home with a problem drinker? If you did, you may have been impacted more than you know. Adult Children of Alcoholics share several common characteristics. They tend to feel different or isolated and uneasy with other people. They are intimidated by authority figures or people who are angry. They seek approval from others and lose themselves in the process. They are people-pleasers.\r\n\r\nThey feel responsible for other people and put their needs before their own. They are terrified of abandonment, and will do almost anything to maintain a relationship even (or especially) if it is unhealthy. They tend to hide their feelings both as children and as adults. They often confuse love with pity and tend to love people they can rescue. They thrive on drama rather than healthy relationships because that is what they grew up with. They often become alcoholics, marry alcoholics or both. The list goes on.\r\n\r\nOn this episode of The Bubble Hour our guests will share their experience both with growing up in an alcoholic home and in a home with someone in recovery. \r\n",

            "description": "Many of us spend years agonizing over the question...\"am I an alcoholic?\" before finally admitting to ourselves that \"yes, I am an alcoholic\". Saying those words out loud for the first time takes a whole lot of courage...and that's just the beginning. Getting and staying sober takes a lot of work and involves changing just about everything about ourselves. Many people join support groups where people suggest we go to a meeting every day? Get a sponsor? Believe in a power greater than ourselves? Let go of our resentments? Practice acceptance, patience and tolerance? Practice self-care? It's a whole new world for us, but if we want to stay sober, we learn to embrace these changes and we thrive. \r\n\r\nBut what about our loved ones and our friends? How do we explain our recovery process to them? Many of us have hidden our disease so well that our loved ones had no idea we were drinking too much. Some will tell us to just stop. Some will suggest we only drink on the weekends or on special occasions. Even the ones who pleaded with us to stop drinking may find it difficult to understand our recovery process. \r\n\r\nOn this episode of The Bubble Hour we will discuss ways to talk to our loved ones about our recovery process and why it needs to be the number one priority in our lives...even above them.\r\n",

Grief can arise from many of life’s challenging situations such as the ending of a relationship, the death of a loved one, the loss or change of jobs, a serious illness or operation. Even getting sober - giving up our addictions - can give rise to grief.\r\n\r\nNow that we are sober, we will sit with many strong emotions - anger, frustration, fear, sadness, guilt, hopelessness, relief, loneliness. And although grief can be a major trigger for relapse (that old impulse to numb our feelings), we find that in sobriety we can handle hard things. We seek fellowship with others in recovery, we use our tools, and we have compassion for our grieving hearts. Join us as we meet some people who are healing their grieving hearts in recovery. With loving kindness, we share this journey and find that our hearts are capable of holding the sacredness of grief.\r\n",

Alcoholism and addiction are characterized by a mental obsession. Our behaviors and thought patterns can defy logic, such as when we drink or use despite consequences or vows to stop. We may feel justified in our drinking or using by anxiety, worry, anger, depression. We may get stuck in this thinking with self-pity, shame, and blame, and the painful cycle continues. \r\n\r\nGratitude is the fastest way out of the despair caused by this cycle! This is why many people in long term recovery subscribe to the notion that an active gratitude practice is an essential part of their sobriety. Join us as we discuss with our guests the ins and outs of a gratitude practice - the ways it helps them stay sober, examples of its benefits, and how to build a practice.

            "description": "Guilt and shame are frequently thought of as the same concept, and the terms are often used interchangeably, they seem to go hand in hand; however, they are not the same. \r\nBoth emotions involve concepts of “wrong” behavior or having done something “wrong,” either by omission or commission. \r\nThey also both involve negative emotions and feelings. On this show, we will explore the difference in these two heavy words. \"Guilt says I've done something wrong; shame says there is something wrong with me. Guilt says I've made a mistake; shame says I am a mistake. Guilt says what did was not good; shame says I am no good.\" \r\nShame is so common in recovery - especially early recovery. Coming to terms with the things we did while actively drinking is a big part of healing. In recovery, we face not just the reality of our own past actions, but the stigma that surrounds addiction as a whole. \r\n There is so much hope, though. By sharing our stories and our truths, we learn we are not alone, and the power of honesty and community help us move out of the darkness of shame and into the light of recovery.\r\n \r\n",

            "description": " There’s an old saying that you’re only as old as you feel. But that’s just telling half of the story. When it comes to those of us of a “certain age,” whatever that age may be, who have been comfortably ensconced in our particular drug of choice for many a year, it may often mean that we believe we are too old to get sober.\r\n Research studies, however, show the negative assessment to be largely a result of conditioning. In other words, if we think something bad about our prospects, especially about our ability to get clean and sober and stay that way, and we’re older adults, guess what? Our belief tends to become reality.\r\n On the other hand, as psychologists and behavioral health professionals readily agree, if we adopt more positive attitudes toward ourselves and our capabilities, it doesn’t matter how old we are. We can still find peace and happiness in a life of sobriety, and we won’t cut ourselves off from the chance to realize this new lifestyle.\r\n On this show we will talk to women who got sober \"after a certain age\" and how they faced their own doubts, the stigma and how they stay sober now. \r\n  \r\n",

            "description": "Many people who try to quit drinking alcohol have at least one relapse before achieving long-term sobriety. For many, a relapse is part of the recovery process. If you had a relapse, all is not lost. It is time to face the facts, pick yourself up, and start back on the road to recovery. A relapse can be a valuable lesson that helps to strengthen resolve and continue to live an even more authentic and fulfilling sober life. Relapsing is not an indictment, it is simply a reality. The problem is that once it has happened to you, it can be overwhelming to face what has happened. There is a tendency to heap blame on yourself, to feel that you are a failure. That is counter-productive. This week on the show, we will be looking at constructive ways to face yourself and move forward after relapse.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we hear stories from guests who have relapsed. We will take an honest look at relapse as it relates to recovery. \r\n",

Who do we ask? What works and what doesn't?  Who is safe to turn to?\r\n On this show we will explore how we asked for help - when we finally surrendered, what we did, how it went, what happened.\r\n We will also talk about asking for help to STAY sober - otherwise known as accountability.  How do we keep accountable? What does that mean to us? Who is in our support network?  What happens when we do (and don't) stay accountable?\r\n Please join us for this important conversation on what is perhaps the most important part of getting and staying sober.\r\n Show airs on June 9th at 9pm EST, 8pm Central, 7pm Mountain and 6pm Pacific.\r\n",

            "description": "\r\n  Quick - what does the word 'vulnerability' mean to you? Does it have positive or negative connotations for you?  Or both?\r\n\r\n  The dictionary defines vulnerabitly as this:  \"the inability to withstand the effects of a hostile environment\".  Other definitions include: \"reduced defensive measures\" or \"susceptible to physical or emontional attack\".\r\n\r\n  Doesn't sound so good, right?\r\n\r\n  So why is vulnerability such a cornerstone to recovery? How do we navigate its potentially treacherous waters?  Why is it so pivotal?\r\n\r\n  Listen Lisa, Amanda and Ellie, co-hosts of The Bubble Hour, as we have an open (and, yes, vulnerable) conversation about the topic of vulnerability.   Through the power of story and shared experience, we discuss what vulnerability means to us, and how it continues to evolve for us as women in recovery from alcoholism.\r\n\r\n  Call in to the show to share your own comments and/or observations!  We'd love to hear from you!\r\n\r\n  \r\n",

Or perhaps it's been so long since we've chased a dream that we need help and support figuring out next steps.  Sometimes we feel a sense of guilt that being sober is supposed to be enough, and that we shouldn't reach for more, fearing our sobriety could be in jeopardy.  Courtney has spent years helping people understand that both are possible: healthy sobriety and finding and/or reaching your heart's dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",

One in ten people in the USA suffer from this disease, and many (if not most) are high functioning: holding down jobs, raising children, being productive members of society\r\n",
