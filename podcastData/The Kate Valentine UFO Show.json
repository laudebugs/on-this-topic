            "description": "People are often skeptical about the UFO phenomenon but phenomenon but they shouldn't be. At least a subset of UFO reports of around 5 percent are from credible witnesses and frequently backed by hard data such as radar tapes or gun camera film. For example astronauts Gordon Cooper and Buzz Aldrin as well as Harvard astronomer Clyde Tombaugh<br />\nhave all publicly described their UFO sightings. But the interesting thing is that we may be on the threshold of understanding the technology of UFOs.  In a nutshell it was once thought that the idea of extra dimensions was strictly  the domain of science fiction. That has all changed in the last several decades as physicists appear to be closing in on a final ''theory of everything'' which suggests we may live in an eleven dimensional universe. These cutting edge theories are now being tested at the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland. Among the theories being tested is one called Warped Geometry by a Harvard physicist which may allow for fast interstellar travel in the extra dimensions. Spectrographic data from actual UFO sightings would confirm if these craft are using technology we are now on the cusp of unraveling.",

For twenty years he led development projects in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. He is now writing and teaching composition in Beijing. http://marcsima.blogspot.com/<br />\n<br />\nListen to the new interview with Martin Willis from podcastufo.com here: http://podcastufo.com/podcast/32-marc-sima-texas-lights/<br />\n<br />\nThe Paul Medoc Series follows the adventures of a Canadian spy from the 1990 Gulf War until the present day. \"Texas Lights\" is the first volume published. It takes place much later, during the year 2008, following the sighting by citizens of Stephenville, TX of strange lights in the sky: \"Paul Medoc is now in his 40s. He has risen through the ranks of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service battling across the globe, both the enemies of Canada, and the complex moral implications of his actions. In any case Medoc has no time for Ufology and consider his mission to Erath County, TX as a sort of strange and risky vacation. He does not know yet that 4 days later his life would have been changed for ever. The Stephenville Lights were, at the time, probably the most talked about UFO event since the 1997 mass sighting in Phoenix, AZ. Witnesses reported that an immense ship was seen heading toward the Presidential ranch some 70 miles away. Few minutes later, the UFO was seen again being chased by a couple of F16. The premise of this novel for me was to try to imagine what would have happened if the President of the United States had been at his summer residence that day and if indeed a mysterious giant ship had breached the strict post 9/11 no fly zone protecting the President at all time. What would have happened if the same evening the Prime Minister of Canada had been scheduled to arrive shortly for an official visit and if the US had refused afterward to provide any information about the incident? I hope the reader will enjoy the fast pace novel as much as I did writing it!\" Marc Sima<br />\n<br />\nTo learn more about our guest please go to:<br />\nhttp://marcsima.blogspot.com/",

            "description": "<img src=\"http://www.atlanticcoastufos.com/Bios/pix/charis.jpg\" border=\"0\"><div>Charis Brown Malloy experienced her initial and very unexpected spiritual awakening while in college. She feared for her sanity until her seeming \"hallucinations\" were systematically verified as valid information. Her \"coming out of the closet\" book,&nbsp; Journal of a Starseed, documents this transition into the esoteric side of life, which occurred as she led a parallel \"normal\" life, earning master's degrees in health and psychology - to angels, ghosts, faeries, and an exorcism she performed on a child's playroom included. The second half of the book, entitled \"All Roads Lead to Aliens\", describes Charis's initial awakening to the extraterrestrial presence and her realization that she was a life long contactee as well as a Starseeded soul. On a continuous journey of discovery that in no way ends with the publication of Journal of a Starseed, Charis is now an author, healer, and lecturer, as well as an administrator on the esoteric forum CosmicYou at www.cosmicyou.us . <br>\nHer website is <a href=\"http://www.journalofastarseed.com\" target=\"blank\">www.journalofastarseed.com</a></div>",

Alien Rock by Michael Luckman is an irreverent, illuminating, all-access pass to the stars' unearthly encounters--some friendly, some frightening, and some frankly bizarre, including: • The birth of Elvis was marked by the appearance ofa mysterious blue light over his house. • In August 1974, John Lennon spied a UFO from the window of the penthouse he shared with then-girlfriend, May Pang. • Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull encountered a luminous cigar-shaped mothership while camping in the English countryside in 1968. • Jimi Hendrix told a friend, \"I am a spiritual messenger, sent here from another place.\" Whether you're a UFO skeptic or a true believer, Alien Rock provides a fascinating new perspective on the long, strange trip that is rock 'n' roll history, and suggests that, wherever the road takes us, we may not be traveling alone.</div>",

After about an hour and one-half, having traveled about 30 degrees from the NNE to the NNW, it then released 15-20 smaller shiny objects, which took varying paths out and away from the main object. Years later, it was determined that this sighting occurred at about the same time the first experimental atom bomb was exploded in New Mexico.",
