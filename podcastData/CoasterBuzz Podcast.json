We find it unbelievable that adults act like this, in a public company, and that the board does nothing about it.</li>\r\n<li>Kentucky Kingdom next year? The mayor wants to issue bonds to help finance the reopening, but has anyone asked if the park even has a future?</li>\r\n<li>Comcast says it will decide if it wants to buy Blackstone's stake in Universal Orlando.

You can remember Moosh by giving to the <a href=\"http://www.lymphoma.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lymphoma Research Foundation</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Another bust in Orlando for second hand theme park tickets.

Get the popcorn, we're ready to watch!</li>\r\n<li>The jokes around \"Festival Tennessee\" start coming almost as soon as it was announced. Gonch gives the project no chance of becoming a reality.</li>\r\n<li>Playland needs a new future. Jeff gets on his soapbox about the dogmatic assertion that government shouldn't be in the business.</li>\r\n<li>Plans approved for a giant Ferris Wheel in Las Vegas. The whole city is in a weird state right now, with half-finished stuff.</li>\r\n<li>Meanwhile, the Sahara is going to close in May, apparently without buyers or hope. No word on what happens to Speed. Jeff wonders if he can find the time to visit Adventure Dome next month when he's in town, for the credit.</li>\r\n<li>The Dells worker who dropped a girl 100 feet is convicted of a felony, but we're generally of the opinion that it's problematic for it to be a crime to do your minimum wage job wrong. It was a tragedy, but that's a different issue from whether or not there was a crime.

We still can't understand how these accidents happen.</li>\r\n<li>Blackstone wants to sell its stake in Universal Orlando. Analysts are down on NBC-Universal Comcast buying it, but why wouldn't they?</li>\r\n<li>Q Funding is suing Cedar Fair again.

Gonch reviews a bit about the new roller coaster there. Jeff wishes there were more local fan sites for amusement parks.</li>\r\n<li>The Disney Dream is like a theme park. Carrie talks about cruises as disease infested capsules. Gonch wants a Fastpass off the boat.</li>\r\n<li>Disney worker arrested for allegedly luring a woman to the resort and raping her. The story doesn't add up very well according to what has been reported.</li>\r\n<li>Cedar Fair gets some credit lubrication. Lubrication is what makes business go.</li>\r\n<li>SeaWorld ready to put trainers back in the water. It has been a year, but Jeff wants to hear more about the safeguards. It will always be dangerous, that's part of the job.</li>\r\n<li>Six Flags America gets a \"Survivor\" live show. Really? Who actually watches anything on CBS?</li>\r\n<li>Ferrari World pats itself on the back for 100 days of operation. Take that, Freestyle!</li>\r\n<li>Six Flags has a very profitable 2010. We think Shapiro really laid the groundwork for that success. And by the way, Gonch thinks that Six Flags America has a nice coaster lineup. Jeff wonders if he ever mentioned that he was on Superman when the chain broke.</li>\r\n<li>Battlestar Galactica dueling roller coaster finally reopens at Universal Singapore. Eleven months seems like a long time to fix a problem. Aside: Remember ragging on Vekoma?</li>\r\n<li>Las Vegas entertains the idea of a new amusement park.

What's with people who are worried about doing every last thing when they go to Disney World? Some people suck at vacations.</li>\r\n<li>Lo-Q has a more profitable year. Funny how everything other than the unemployment rate implies that the economy is improving.</li>\r\n<li>Cedar Fair charges a buck an inch for a crappy sub. And they're surprised that their per cap is down?</li>\r\n<li>Universal Orlando's grand achievement, in the form of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, has amazing results for the year. No shocker there.</li>\r\n<li>Stay tuned... we're announcing something new very soon.</li>\r\n<li>The Fall Affair at Holiday World will be September 17, 2011... save the date!</li>\r\n\r\n<li>You can get the latest headlines on CoasterBuzz from the Twitter.

Gonch got his start by being active in the old games site.</li>\r\n<li>The live podcasts, where we met in person, are still some of the best.</li>\r\n<li>CoasterBuzz has only existed in four flavors since it launched. Would like to revise it again before the end of this year.</li>\r\n<li>Jeff worried about all of the wrong things back when CoasterBuzz started.</li>\r\n<li>A Disney-focused site next? It could happen...</li>\r\n<li>Richard calls in from early morning in Dublin. He's been on Formula Rossa at Ferrari World, and he suggests that it probably pushes the limits of what's comfortable to ride.</li>\r\n<li>He also wonders what the long-term prognosis of the park is, because it was virtually empty.</li>\r\n<li>Eye protection is required on Rossa (he's looking at you, Knott's Berry Farm).</li>\r\n<li>Jeff got his Wizarding World of Harry Potter on at Universal's Islands of Adventure. Verdict: Awesome.</li>\r\n<li>Best times to visit Universal Orlando? Check the on-site hotel rates and operating hours.</li>\r\n<li>Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is an amazing achievement end to end, queue to ride system.</li>\r\n<li>Aside: Screen actors on the stage.</li>\r\n<li>Unit holders force split from CEO and chair at Cedar Fair. Another board member fills the spot. What's next? Hard to say. The real story comes from the selection of a new CEO to replace Kinzel next year.</li>\r\n<li>Universal kills it with rise in attendance. Jeff learns that Islands of Adventure is all based in literary themes.</li>\r\n<li>Mt. Olympus owner buys up hotels for rehab. Good for the area? The bar isn't very high to begin with.</li>\r\n<li>Jeff takes a moment to complain about how there aren't many roller coasters to ride in the northwest (again).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>You can get the latest headlines on CoasterBuzz from the Twitter.

Watch out for severed chicken heads.</li>\r\n<li>Canobie Lake Park waiting on the traffic study to proceed with Euro Fighter.</li>\r\n<li>Extreme World civil suit settled out of court, criminal trial of operator yet to come. We're still not comfortable with the precedent of someone doing a minimum wage job being charged with a crime.</li>\r\n<li>Food &amp; Wine Festival begins at Epcot. It's about cheese and wine, not drink around the world advance mode. Sidebar: box wine.</li>\r\n<li>Checketts is out at S&amp;S, no longer holding any stake and not consulting. What's with entrepreneurs that totally let go of something they started?</li>\r\n<li>Cedar Fair sets out concrete financial goals for 2015, and reinstates the distribution.

They're the new drop tower.</li>\r\n<li>Minor accident involving rollback on Pony Express at Knott's Berry Farm injures ten people. Expect the state to shut it down and investigate for two years.</li>\r\n<li>Zippin Pippin rises in Green Bay. How many roller coasters did Elvis actually ever ride?</li>\r\n<li>Mental illness advocates ask Cedar Point to shut down its asylum haunted attractions. Mike says it's the fault of Hollywood.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"http://coasterbuzz.com/content/BooBuzz2010.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">BooBuzz returns to Cedar Point</a> on Friday, October 15.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>You can get the latest headlines on CoasterBuzz from the Twitter.
