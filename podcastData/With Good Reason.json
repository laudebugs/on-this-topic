Matt Oyos explains how Roosevelt modernized the military to bolster America’s international presence. Also: Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was the foremost presidential historian of the 20th century. Over the course of his career, he won two Pulitzer prizes and was a close friend and advisor to former president, John F. Kennedy. Emile Lester says Schlesinger’s work can teach us a lot about what makes a successful liberal presidency.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: What makes a leader decide to go to war? Is the decision based solely on facts on the ground or does it have something to do with personality? Dennis Foster and Jonathan Keller have developed a psychological framework for uncovering why leaders do the things they do.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=NF2g2U2loxY:olArjEhqwYo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=NF2g2U2loxY:olArjEhqwYo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=NF2g2U2loxY:olArjEhqwYo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=NF2g2U2loxY:olArjEhqwYo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/NF2g2U2loxY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Gilda Daniels’ new book Uncounted: Voter Suppression in the United States explores how updated versions of these barriers--like voter ID laws and misinformation--are undermining our democracy.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: This election has a lot of people worried about voting--how to do it and how to make it count. Jennifer Victor (George Mason University) walks us through the best way to cast our ballots this November and what to expect from a pandemic election. Plus: With the institution of no-excuse absentee voting, states like Virginia could see drastically different polling than in past years. Rosalyn Cooperman (University of Mary Washington) breaks down who this policy impacts most, and why your absentee vote is so essential this year.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=nuGVzhYSd9k:-6Kgbm2EnoQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=nuGVzhYSd9k:-6Kgbm2EnoQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=nuGVzhYSd9k:-6Kgbm2EnoQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=nuGVzhYSd9k:-6Kgbm2EnoQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/nuGVzhYSd9k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Steven Zeichner cautions against prematurely approving a vaccine that later has significant safety concerns. Plus: With colder temperatures, how risky is it to dine indoors again? Linsey Marr says plenty risky. The tiny aerosols are like cigarette smoke and can pose a risk to anyone in the room. Also: For the estimated 7 million American adults who are immuno-compromised, traveling to a doctor’s office for a vaccine could be a massive risk. Julian Zhu is developing a mailable stick-on patch that would allow people to vaccinate from home. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: After being nearly eradicated, black lung has made a strong resurgence in central Appalachia. Aysha Bodenhamer looks at the human costs of so-called cheap fuel in coal country. And: The term self-help calls to mind home-organizing strategies and meditation guides. But in the 1960s and 70s, a different kind of feminist self-help movement was revolutinizing women’s healthcare. Hannah Dudley-Shotwell’s new book shares the history of the women who founded clinics, published pamphlets and books, performed medical procedures, and helped a generation of women reclaim control over their bodies.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=0R8vquOr6_Y:bIS9Y0GWJto:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=0R8vquOr6_Y:bIS9Y0GWJto:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=0R8vquOr6_Y:bIS9Y0GWJto:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=0R8vquOr6_Y:bIS9Y0GWJto:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/0R8vquOr6_Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

But even as shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race and Pose bring that culture into the mainstream, real-life gay bars and clubs are shuttering. DJ and Professor Madison Moore argues that the club scene and the “fabulous” fashions on display there are radical spaces for queer and trans of color togetherness. Gregory Samantha Rosenthal, Don Muse, and Peter Thornhill describe the sometimes-dangerous, always-exciting gay bars of the 1970s and 1980s in Roanoke, VA, before the AIDS crisis and gentrification changed the scene forever. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: Choreographer and performer Al Evangelista brings us into the world of experimental queer Pilipinx dance, a form that he and his collaborators say can spark conversations and social change. And: Growing up, Lauron Kehrer’s parents wouldn’t let her listen to hip-hop music. Now, she studies it for a living. Kehrer says hip-hop by both straight and LGBTQ artists can help us better understand race, gender, and sexuality.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=_dq_GnUbikY:EQBluFV4p9I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=_dq_GnUbikY:EQBluFV4p9I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=_dq_GnUbikY:EQBluFV4p9I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=_dq_GnUbikY:EQBluFV4p9I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/_dq_GnUbikY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Sure enough, in 2020, we’ve seen hundreds of thousands of people marching in the streets, guns flying off of the shelves and police and military using weapons against civilians. And there are 3 months left in the year. Can Predicting Hotspots help us see ahead to 2021? Christie Jones was working in homeland security when Trayvon Martin was murdered by a neighborhood vigilante. She began questioning why addressing terrorism wasn’t a priority for securing the nation, shifting her perspective from homeland to human security. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: As an undergraduate student, Juan Garibay found himself frustrated by his math program as an undergraduate student. How could it be the best program in the nation if it couldn’t connect STEM to social justice?

David Bearinger discusses the complexity of the immigrant and refugee experience for the individuals and families who have lived and are living it. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: The contributions that Irish nuns made to help destitute immigrant Catholic children in New York City were instrumental in developing modern American social institutions like foster care and welfare. Before the nuns aided these children, they were being sent to live with Protestant families, often never seeing their parents again. Maureen Fitzgerald speaks about what lessons can be learnt from the Irish immigrant experience.

Eric Hallerman (Virginia Tech) makes the case for accepting some of them.  Also: When a person’s time is taken up by the needs of daily subsistence due to poverty, environmental concerns can recede as a priority. When we talked to Camellia Moses Okpodu for this interview, she was at Norfolk State University (Xavier University) investigating ways to get more disenfranchised minorities and people who are economically at risk interested in environmental activism.\r\n\r\nLater in the show:  In July of 1975, news spread that workers at a factory in Hopewell, Virginia had been poisoned by an insecticide called Kepone.  Greg Wilson (The University of Akron) was a Virginia Humanities Fellow and historian who traces the environmental crisis that followed with the discovery that the James River and marine life were saturated with the chemical. And: What if there was an app that worked like GoogleMaps, but for marine animals? Sara Maxwell (University of Washington - Bothwell) is using satellite tracking to help fisheries avoid catching animals like whales, turtles, and sharks while they’re hunting for other fish.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=-MN9Gl_bipU:RUKfJfaclxI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=-MN9Gl_bipU:RUKfJfaclxI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=-MN9Gl_bipU:RUKfJfaclxI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=-MN9Gl_bipU:RUKfJfaclxI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/-MN9Gl_bipU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Michael Gilbert (University of Virginia) shares the latest on gerrymandering. And: Since 2016, states like Michigan and Ohio have made news for a turn to the Republican party. Democrats, meanwhile, see hope in traditionally red Southern states that have been turning blue. Quentin Kidd (Christopher Newport University) talks about what this process has looked like in Virginia and what’s spurring it on.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: Fake news wasn't invented by the Internet. It has long been used as a way to demonize political opponents. Elizabeth Losh (William & Mary) says there are fake news stories that appeal to both the left and the right.

He also held captive more than 600 enslaved men, women, and children in his lifetime. Architects Mabel O. Wilson (Columbia University) and Louis Nelson (University of Virginia) discuss Jefferson’s conflicting ideals. Also featured: Erik Neil (Chrysler Museum of Art) takes us through the new Chrysler exhibit that explores the inherent conflict between Jefferson’s pursuit of liberty and democracy and his use of enslaved laborers to construct his monuments.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: Phillip Herrington (James Madison University) says the white-columned plantation house is one of the most enduring and divisive icons of American architecture. Also: The history of segregation is not just in our architecture, but in other public arts.

In the years since, as residents have come and gone and rebuilt their lives, a lot has changed about the city-- including, says Katie Carmichael (Virginia Tech), the way people talk. \r\n\r\nThe author of Sudden Spring, Rick Van Noy (Radford University) says that, in many Southern communities, climate change is already here. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: Residents of Tangier Island could become some of America’s first climate refugees—unless they get a much needed sea wall. Through a partnership with Google, a Virginia project is hoping to raise awareness of Tangier’s plight by allowing people from anywhere in the world to visit the endangered island—virtually.\r\n\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of citizens of island nations stand to lose their homes to rising sea levels. Anthony Boese is studying the ethical, political, and economic decisions needed when masses of people are forced to leave their island homelands. \r\n\r\nIs there a better way to assess the potential damage of an approaching hurricane? Meteorologist Stephanie Zick (Virginia Tech) believes that studying how, where, and when hurricane loses its power can give us a more accurate picture.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=UGWxznVMKsA:DyELyccFoFk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=UGWxznVMKsA:DyELyccFoFk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=UGWxznVMKsA:DyELyccFoFk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=UGWxznVMKsA:DyELyccFoFk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/UGWxznVMKsA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Wendy Welch (University of Virginia College at Wise) asked more than sixty social workers, parents, and children who have gone through foster care what it’s like. Their stories show the desperation, frustration, compassion, and hope of foster families in the Appalachian coalfields.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=5785nZA6ask:J-UsOS1UZrI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=5785nZA6ask:J-UsOS1UZrI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=5785nZA6ask:J-UsOS1UZrI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=5785nZA6ask:J-UsOS1UZrI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/5785nZA6ask\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

            "description": "In 1883 a young African American worker was alleged to have brushed shoulders with a white woman as they passed each other on a narrow sidewalk in Danville, Virginia. A race riot erupted and Jane Dailey (University of Chicago) says the white supremacist backlash that followed led to the disenfranchisement of Black Virginians for nearly 100 years. And: Jeff McClurken (University of Mary Washington) discusses the life of a Danville industrialist and former Confederate soldier, William T. Sutherlin, who led a skewed Congressional investigation into the 1883 riot. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: Danville was like many small southern towns and cities after the civil war. Caitlin Verboon (Virginia Tech) studies how white and black citizens viewed each other and interacted in the post-war years.  Plus: Tom Costa (University of Virginia at Wise) connects the dots between the Danville riots and the codification of Jim Crow laws in Virginia’s Constitution of  1902.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=FuF-OtKhSSc:6JhdNqLDfo4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=FuF-OtKhSSc:6JhdNqLDfo4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=FuF-OtKhSSc:6JhdNqLDfo4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=FuF-OtKhSSc:6JhdNqLDfo4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/FuF-OtKhSSc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Aran Shetterly (Virginia Humanities Fellow), who is writing a book about the incident, says it still reverberates in the racial politics of Greensboro today. Also: The European philosophers of the Enlightenment argued that Europeans were civilized, but Africans were barbarians. Stefan Wheelock (George Mason University) describes how radical African American writers used those same philosophical principles to unmask the barbarism of slavery.\r\n\r\nLater on: One of the darkest chapters of American history is the racial terror inflicted on thousands of African Americans through lynching. Gianluca De Fazio (James Madison University) and his students have developed a website Racial Terror: Lynching in Virginia, 1877-1927 that focuses on telling the stories of the 104 known lynching victims who were killed in Virginia between 1877 and 1927, nearly all of them African American men. Plus: Renee Hill (Virginia State University) coordinated a memorial service to pay tribute to the lives of the thousands of people who suffered lynching in the United States.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=gKz99cC7-h4:HIJapIuFBfM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=gKz99cC7-h4:HIJapIuFBfM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=gKz99cC7-h4:HIJapIuFBfM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=gKz99cC7-h4:HIJapIuFBfM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/gKz99cC7-h4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

            "description": "The word obscenity comes from the Greek concept of “off-stage.” Violence, sexuality, abuse—these are the things that we consider private, things that should happen off-stage. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Paula Vogel brings these perceived obscenities into the public eye and under the theatre spotlight. Throughout her accomplished career, Vogel has tackled traditionally taboo subjects including homosexuality, race, incest, and abuse. In a different role, Vogel has also distinguished herself as an exceptional teacher of young playwrights. Over the years, four of her students have gone on to win Pulitzer Prizes themselves.\r\n\r\nLater in the show:  In Mexico, theaters are more than just a place for entertainment. Jacqueline Bixler says they are a forum for working out the traumatic events that have shaped Mexican history.  Bixler was named Outstanding Faculty of 2016 by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.  Also:  Ann Marie Stock has opened her heart to Cuban film and her home to Cuban filmmakers. She has traveled regularly to Cuba and was in Havana when the American flag was raised at the U.S. embassy for the first time in more than half a century.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=lyYhXL_wdJI:aeWp8SJ4KMU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=lyYhXL_wdJI:aeWp8SJ4KMU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=lyYhXL_wdJI:aeWp8SJ4KMU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=lyYhXL_wdJI:aeWp8SJ4KMU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/lyYhXL_wdJI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Parrish talks with us about how communication evolves, and how wildly different species of animals employ similar persuasive tactics in order to solve similar problems. And: In Norfolk’s Calvert Square, preschoolers plant watermelon and okra next to 200,000 live bees. They aren’t alone. Carrie “Honeybee” Brown has planted apiaries in community gardens across the city in an effort to save the ailing honeybee. Now, she’s planning to shave bees and attach transmitters to get neighbourhood kids interested in entomology.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: Biologist Kevin Hamed discovered a consistently alarming number of tiny skulls stuck in glass bottles found roadside litter. Tiny shrews are crawling in, but can’t get back out. He and his students are on the case, trying to solve mysteries where humans and the wilderness intersect. Plus: A study in Appalacia is taking very close look at roadkill. James Vance and Gabrielle Smith  hope to find ways to help animals avoid crossing a particularly high-traffic area.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=9E4iIRkFV8g:oAP55R4pxNc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=9E4iIRkFV8g:oAP55R4pxNc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=9E4iIRkFV8g:oAP55R4pxNc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=9E4iIRkFV8g:oAP55R4pxNc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/9E4iIRkFV8g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Joshua Zingher says these betting markets are a more accurate predictor than election polls. And: Millennials, one of six living generations today, are the largest generational cohort in American history. Typically characterized as those born between 1980 and 1997, millennials reached an important milestone by the end of 2015: for the first time, all 80 million were of voting age. Quentin Kidd Newport looks at the influence of Millennials on the upcoming election.  Plus: These days, we do a decent job of getting women into congress, but the vast majority of them are Democrats. Rosalyn Cooperman argues this party imbalance has a lot to do with funding from PACs like Emily’s List. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: An entire generation of Americans grew up knowing no other president than Franklin Roosevelt, who served four terms and led them through the Depression and World War II. Pulitzer Prize winning FDR biographer David Kennedy gives a spellbinding account of this ebullient man of constant cheer who crafted the New Deal and the social security system.

Kevin Concannon, an expert on Ono’s work, notes she was an accomplished and innovative artist long before she met Lennon. Plus: A new novel by Fred D’Aguiar tells the story of a mother and daughter caught up in the tragic Jonestown mass suicide of 1978. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: Americans have been getting their kicks from Route 66 since John Steinbeck labeled it “The Mother Road” in The Grapes of Wrath. Michael Lund is fascinated by the nostalgic small town life found along “America’s Main Street.” Lund is the author of a series of Route 66 novels. And: Jack Kerouac wrote about his travels along Route 66 in On the Road, the novel that made him a literary success. Gordon Ball says Kerouac’s novel about the Beat Generation is as relevant today as it was in the 1950s.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=Y2lvQQ0XtPg:YwBwRKyDJuE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=Y2lvQQ0XtPg:YwBwRKyDJuE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=Y2lvQQ0XtPg:YwBwRKyDJuE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=Y2lvQQ0XtPg:YwBwRKyDJuE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/Y2lvQQ0XtPg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

In his new book, “A Cuban in Mayberry,” Pérez-Firmat discovers that even though a Cuban would never live in a town like The Andy Griffith Show’s Mayberry, he feels that, in a way, Mayberry is home. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: An influx of foreigners with a desire to share your resources is nothing new to the Cherokee. “The Cherokee Diaspora” by Gregory Smithers details the Cherokee evolution from a close group to a people of multiple communities. Also: “Border Odyssey” by Charles Thompson Jr. tells how Thompson left his small organic farm in North Carolina and traveled the entire length of the nearly 2,000 mile border between the United States and Mexico.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=i6-ZDsAnAF0:luS4ln_7Oh0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=i6-ZDsAnAF0:luS4ln_7Oh0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=i6-ZDsAnAF0:luS4ln_7Oh0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=i6-ZDsAnAF0:luS4ln_7Oh0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/i6-ZDsAnAF0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

His painting of the scene was later exhibited at the Royal Gallery in London in 1861.  In her book, Slaves Waiting for Sale, Maurie McInnis describes the impact this pivotal painting had on the British public at the outbreak of the American Civil War. Greg Kimball talks about a new exhibition of art dealing with the American slave trade.  Also: Jonathan White says many Union soldiers were not for re-election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864, and were in fact pressured to vote for him. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: 1619 was the year the first Africans arrived in North America. Many were Christians with European names like Jean Pedro and Angela, and some came from cities. Scholars Linda Heywood and John Thornton discussed the lives of these first Africans at Norfolk State University’s 1619: The Making of America conference. Also: Recently discovered essays by an anonymous writer who called himself “The Humourist” are now being hailed as some of the best essays in America’s colonial period.

And those who need new organs will be getting new biological parts from 3-D printers.  That’s the vision of Kenneth Brayman, who heads Transplant Surgery at the University of Virginia.  Brayman discusses recent advances in organ transplantation.  Also: Allergic reactions to everything from pollen to peanuts are making life miserable for millions.  Lawrence Schwartz explains why our bodies over-react to these seemingly benign substances.  Schwartz was named Outstanding Faculty of 2016 by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.\r\n\r\nLater in the show:  People who get a kick out of lying are said to have “duping delight.” Randy Boyle studies human deception at the Longwood Center for Cyber Security. He has devised a questionnaire that measures a person’s propensity to lie. Also: Each year there are many food recall or contamination alerts, but not everyone heeds the warnings. Christopher Brady  looks at the psychological factors that determine which of us will act on the alerts. And: Researcher Andrew Neilson has found that certain flavanols in cocoa can reduce weight gain. His study identified one particular compound in cocoa prevented laboratory mice from gaining excess weight when fed a high-fat diet.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=Gt0Tg1mLcvo:AeYXMjPP2qo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=Gt0Tg1mLcvo:AeYXMjPP2qo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=Gt0Tg1mLcvo:AeYXMjPP2qo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=Gt0Tg1mLcvo:AeYXMjPP2qo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/Gt0Tg1mLcvo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

For Earth Day, With Good Reason speaks with Pulitzer Prize winning writer Dan Fagin, whose 2013 book, Tom's River: A Story of Science and Salvation tells the story of how that small town fought against the pollution—and the polluters—killing their children. Fagin also discusses his current project, a book that follows the plight of the monarch butterfly as it tries to survive the very real changes that humans have brought to this planet. Plus: Meet Marc Edwards the professor who helped uncover the water crises in Flint, Michigan and has now been charged with fixing it.\r\n\r\nLater in the show:  Growing up in Appalachia, Maddison Couch noticed an unusual number of thyroid disorders in her community. As a student at she discovered new information suggesting that these disorders weren’t inherited—they’re caused by coal. And: The distinctive appearance of the largest salamander in North America has inspired some colorful nicknames: hellbenders, big log of snot, ol¹ lasagna sides, and snot otter.

She discusses the influence of Tolkien and medieval literature on the popular program.\r\nAnd: Can a play written more than 400 years ago have something to say about Muslim-Americans? Some Shakespeare experts think so. In advance of Old Dominion University’s Shakespeare 400 Years After event, Imtiaz Habib and Maya Mathur explore what Shakespeare’s plays can reveal about life today. Plus: It’s hard to find a nuanced black character written by 19th century white authors. But Gretchen Martin says she’s found trickster characters (think Br’er Rabbit) in some 19th century classics.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: During the 1910s and 1920s, the question of whether one was “highbrow” or “lowbrow” became a concern in the minds of modernist Americans. Brooks Hefner says this “brow anxiety” dominated the career of Willard Huntington Wright, who fancied himself an intellectual aristocrat while secretly writing a series of wildly popular detective stories under the pseudonym S.S. Van Dine. And: When Christopher McGee first discovered the Hardy Boys books as a child, he had no idea the author, Franklin W. Dixon, was fictitious and that the books were written by ghostwriters.

And: We all know of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin, but few of us have heard of Robert Morris, who was also a founding father.

Maria DeValpine spent three years learning why nurses elect to stay in this challenging environment on the edge of the earth. And: Courses that include service learning projects can have a profound effect on college students.

            "description": "Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison was born Chloe Wofford in 1931. She was 39 when she published her first novel about a black girl’s painful coming of age in a white society. The Bluest Eye and many subsequent works have earned Morrison the highest accolades in literature and established her as one of America’s leading fiction writers. Nikki Giovanni and Joanne Gabbin paid tribute to Morrison with an extravaganza at Virginia Tech that included nationally renowned writers, singers, and poets, and the late Maya Angelou. With Good Reason interviewed Morrison and shares highlights from that night of tributes. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: The author of Equal Time: Television and the Civil Rights Movement explores how the newly created evening news shows shaped attitudes about race relations during the Civil Rights Movement. Aniko Bodroghkozy   investigates the network news treatment of events including the 1965 Selma voting rights campaign, integration riots at the University of Mississippi, and the March on Washington. Also featured: Stephen Alcorn is the illustrator of the children’s book Odetta: The Queen of Folk, which tells the story of the legendary singer and social activist known as “the Voice of the Civil Rights Movement.” The book follows her renowned career and her influence on many of the most important singers of the folk revival of the 1960s.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=DIs73GHu1mU:YywXq137_CA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=DIs73GHu1mU:YywXq137_CA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=DIs73GHu1mU:YywXq137_CA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=DIs73GHu1mU:YywXq137_CA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/DIs73GHu1mU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Also: The history of the great American game of baseball represents all the paradoxes of race relations in our country. Johnny Moore studies the surprising shift from the 1920’s, when baseball held an important place within the black community, to today, where that place lies in the NBA.  \r\nLater in the show: The late Julian Bond conducted 51 extensive interviews with prominent black leaders in America. Phyllis Leffler, who led the project with Bond, has written a book on the series that offers insights into the intractable disparities of race in America.   Also: In the 1940’s Fatima Massaquoi penned one of the earliest known autobiographies by an African woman. Arthur Abraham is one of three editors of The Autobiography of an African Princess, which traces Fatima’s life from her youth in Africa to her later years in America.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=tHNWhFcHPY4:U6xzYaePNkQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=tHNWhFcHPY4:U6xzYaePNkQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=tHNWhFcHPY4:U6xzYaePNkQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=tHNWhFcHPY4:U6xzYaePNkQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/tHNWhFcHPY4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Beth Cabrera shares what she learned through interviews with more than a thousand women about how to find a happy balance. Plus: Researchers have found specific genetic markers in a population of Chinese Han women that predispose them to the risk for clinical depression. Kenneth Kendler was part of the team that made the breakthrough. And: A sculptor frustrated with the direction of her metal work decided to take a break and knit “cozies” for all of her tools–her drill, welding mask, and even her pickup truck. Kristin Skees next created what she calls her Husband Cozy Series, which plays on the idea of a trophy wife. Now she’s flooded with requests for “Cozy Portraits.”\r\n\r\nLater in the show: If you accidently scrape a stranger’s car and nobody sees, what do you do? Do you leave a note? Do you track the owner down? Bill Hawk and Erica Lewis give coping strategies for deciding what to do when faced with an ethical dilemma. Plus: Zooplankton are microscopic animals in the ocean that are critical to both the food chain and the recycling of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deborah Steinberg Marine Science says that due to climate change there’s been a change in the distribution and variation of zooplankton.

The findings by Thomas Flores (George Mason University) might lead to a review of common regime-change practices. Also: April Faye Manalong (Norfolk State University) says that the concept of 'indebtedness' to their new home in the United States is a prime motivating factor among the Filipino community. It is also a factor in the communities' strong ties to military service. Plus: One-for-one models of giving purport to offer consumers a simple way to fight poverty. But as Shawn Humphrey (University of Mary Washington) learned from his own charitable efforts in Honduras, the work of doing good is a complex process and one that requires constant humility.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: In the 1970s, a series of laws ushered in a new \"sunshine era\" of unprecedented government transparency.

Thomas McSweeney (College of William and Mary) says he doesn't think its authors intended it to be the foundational text for common law that it became.

And: Depression affects almost 15 million American adults, yet doctors still don’t know much about how it works. Researcher Pearl Chiu says that it may be possible to make a personalized diagnosis of depression through brain imaging. Plus: Lisa Ellison's brother was plagued with mental health issues until age 20, when he committed an awful crime and then took his own life. Lisa graduated from the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program at James Madison University and is now an advocate for suicide prevention and mental health support.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: HIV infections are rising among a surprising segment of the population--African Americans over the age of 50.  John Fife is working to combat this disturbing trend.  And: Millions of people in developing countries go blind due to cataracts because there aren’t enough surgeons trained in the five-minute procedure to remove them.

Join us as Bill Kissell, Donna Carty, and Dena Radley share favorite letters that reveal the fascinating inner lives of the founders.

But a big Victorian house captured their imaginations and before they knew it they were setting up shop. Despite the growing popularity of e-readers and a downturn in the national economy, Jack and Wendy’s small-town bookstore is thriving—and fostering community.

This special Veteran's Day episode of With Good Reason shares memories from an NBA All-Star who played pickup games with the troops in the jungle; a soldier who navigated the Mekong Delta in a patrol boat while his baby daughter was born back home; a flight attendant who firmly told the soldiers, \"See you on the way back\"; and a young marine whose life was saved by the sacrifice of a friend.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: In the 1960s, it took almost three weeks to cross the sea from America to Vietnam. Three weeks for young men in crowded cabins with salt water showers and absolutely nothing to do but think about home, the war, and what might be next. In this episode we focus on a single troopship, the General Nelson M. Walker, and a few of the soldiers who traveled on it. There’s the man who wrote home about the voyage to Vietnam—about tanning oil, hillbilly radio, and a run-in with a typhoon. Another who survived the jungles of Vietnam, only to return home and feel as though democracy had passed him by. And then there’s the fiancée who snuck on board to say one last goodbye to her lover before he was killed in action. These stories were produced in partnership with The Vietnam Graffiti Project.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=uyinxOPhbhc:fvH0C8MtscM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=uyinxOPhbhc:fvH0C8MtscM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=uyinxOPhbhc:fvH0C8MtscM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=uyinxOPhbhc:fvH0C8MtscM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/uyinxOPhbhc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

And:  Twitter is speeding up communication about racial incidents.  Bridgett Robertson says three-fourths of all African-Americans use Twitter to discuss political and social issues of importance to the black community.  \r\nAlso: The Geography of Slavery is a website that catalogues more than 4,000 advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves (including one written by Thomas Jefferson) placed in newspapers in the later part of the 18th century.

            "description": "Ferdinand the Cultural Icon (September 26, 2015)\r\nThe beloved children’s book The Story of Ferdinand, about a bull who would rather smell flowers than fight matadors, is among the most widely read and translated children’s books of the 20th Century. Sharon McQueen (Old Dominion University) says Ferdinand became highly controversial, and has been called a pacifist, “the first hippie hero,” an “antisocial layabout,” and a “confirmed schizoid with a strong flower fetish.” Ernest Hemingway even wrote a fable, “The Faithful Bull,” rebutting its message. Also: Thousands of old library books bear fascinating traces of the past. Readers wrote in their books, and left pictures, letters, flowers, locks of hair, and other things between their pages. Andy Stauffer (University of Virginia) says libraries are discarding these old books as they go digital. Books printed between 1820 and 1923 are at particular risk.  \r\n\r\nLater in the show: Murder, mystery, and poetry come together in medieval scholar Bruce Holsinger’s (University of Virginia) novel set in Chaucer’s London. Plus, Faulkner Fox (Virginia Foundation for the Humanities) has a new novel that explores the complexity of race relations for southerners in the 1980s.

The water in that lake is disappearing, and Skip Watts and George Stephenson (Radford University) are studying why. And: Virginia’s shoreline is expecting a sea level rise of as much as three feet or more by 2060. Ray Toll (Old Dominion University) says the White House has chosen ODU to lead a pilot project to create a comprehensive local response to the flooding to be used as a model for the rest of the nation. Plus: The earliest environmentalists weren’t tree-huggers; they were hunters and colonialists. Historian Stephen Macekura (Indiana University) traces how African conservation has been closely tied with colonialism and development.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: Early struggles between Native Americans and the U.S. government centered on gold claims. But James Allison (Christopher Newport University) says the tension now centers on the new black gold—coal. Plus: Emily Satterwhite (Virginia Tech) talks about two very different images of Appalachia: the pastoral, small towns of literature and the often violent cannibals of horror films. And: In the mid-90s, Latino immigrants started to migrate to smaller towns in the South. Barbara Ellen Smith (Virginia Tech) says the new Appalachia includes chicken enchiladas and tamales.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=5SBg9ZO7Iys:JAkIoj1ci_M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=5SBg9ZO7Iys:JAkIoj1ci_M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=5SBg9ZO7Iys:JAkIoj1ci_M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=5SBg9ZO7Iys:JAkIoj1ci_M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/5SBg9ZO7Iys\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

It’s becoming so common that Thomas Linneman (College of William and Mary) studied its use by contestants on the game show Jeopardy. He found women use it more than men, but male contestants often use “uptalk” after a woman competitor gets a wrong answer. And: Most of us think the best way to motivate is with rewards like money. But best-selling author Dan Pink says that’s a mistake. He says the secret to high performance and satisfaction is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to create new things, and to better our world.\r\n\r\nAlso featured: First published in 1947, Goodnight Moon has become one of the most popular books for young children. Yet the book’s author, Margaret Wise Brown, always wanted to write for adults. With Good Reason’s Kelley Libby tells the story of Brown’s life, from Hollins College to her tragic early death. Also featured: After World War II, the International Youth Library in Munich was created to promote understanding by introducing Germany’s children to the literature of other cultures. It’s now the largest repository of children’s literature in the world. Dr. Osayimwense Osa (Virginia State University) is a former fellow at the library. He says the internationalizing of children’s literature is a step toward world peace. And: With busy schedules and media-soaked lives, have our children lost their ability to engage in moment-by-moment experiences?

And he says older people have an important job to do. Also featured: As we age, we all experience changes in our brains that make our memories less sharp than they used to be. But some older people actually have a condition called Mild Cognitive Impairment, or MCI, which is different from Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Rosemary Blieszner (Virginia Tech) was instrumental in a study that looked at how patients and their family members cope with MCI.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=oShQlixVEpM:G6bYxOGH_tA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=oShQlixVEpM:G6bYxOGH_tA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=oShQlixVEpM:G6bYxOGH_tA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=oShQlixVEpM:G6bYxOGH_tA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/oShQlixVEpM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

We talk with Amy Butler Greenfield, author of A Perfect Red: Empire, Espionage, and the Quest for the Color of Desire, about the history of this highly sought-after commodity that eluded pirates, scientists, and kings. Plus: When restoring priceless works of art, conservators often want to know the origins of the paint. Chemist Kristen Wustholz (College of William & Mary) works with art curators to trace the molecular “fingerprints” of rare paint pigments and has produced a technique that allows precise chemical analysis from a single near-microscopic particle excised from the painting. And: Nuclear physicist Gail Dodge (Old Dominion University) has taken a leading role in atom-smashing experiments. Dodge, who won an Outstanding Faculty Award from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, is also devoted to growing the number of women in a field that is still dominated by men.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: In 2009, fewer than 2% of physical science degrees—like physics and chemistry—went to African-Americans. Considering African-Americans make up 12% of the U.S. population, these numbers are shockingly low. And they’re getting even lower. In the second episode of our ongoing series about STEM education, we ask: what does a scientist look like? Short, tall, black, brown, male or female? We talk to four young scientists about their outreach project at William and Mary’s Virginia Institute of Marine Science.

But by the start of World War II, a number of German physicians were directly involved in the mass killings of the Holocaust. Theodore Reiff (Christopher Newport University) looks at the subversion of German doctors in the Nazi era. Also featured: The movie The Great Escape dramatizes the experience of American and European prisoners of war in Germany during World War II. But little known is that there were more than 400,000 German prisoners of war in 700 camps across America. Charles Ford (Norfolk State University) and Jeffrey Littlejohn (Sam Houston State University) look at the 4,000 German prisoners in Huntsville, Texas and efforts to “de-Nazify” them.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: More than 20 years after Germans tore down the Berlin Wall, they are still negotiating how to deal with the stigmas of a formerly divided country. Jason James (University of Mary Washington) says there are still divisions within German culture—between the “good” former West Germans and the “bad” former East Germans—and both sides struggle with a problematic past that includes Nazi and Fascist associations that persist, even in a united country. Also featured: In the years leading up to World War I, Germany joined other world powers in colonizing parts of Africa. Christian Davis (James Madison University) says there’s a relationship between the racial subjugation that occurred in Germany’s African colonies and the rise of an anti-Semitic movement back home—a movement that would later form the ideological core of Nazism.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=XcBm0EzRG3M:RAm1SuF_aog:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=XcBm0EzRG3M:RAm1SuF_aog:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=XcBm0EzRG3M:RAm1SuF_aog:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=XcBm0EzRG3M:RAm1SuF_aog:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/XcBm0EzRG3M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

As director of the University of Virginia's Innocence Project, Enright has a front row view of failures in our judicial system, from underpaid and inept lawyers to over-eager and biased police officers. Plus: Steve Helvin was a district court judge for 21 years. He says that incorrect rulings probably happen more than you might expect and the court system should be ready to reverse bad decisions.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: When it comes to love, jealousy is sometimes thought of as “natural” or even desirable. But a recent survey led by Mindy Erchull (University of Mary Washington) suggests that women who see jealousy as a positive thing may be more likely to find themselves in abusive relationships. Also: Tragedies like the Newtown shootings dominate the debate over gun ownership. But in an average year, suicides outnumber homicides by 3 to 1 and most are by firearm. Alex Tabarrok (George Mason University) and Justin Briggs  say a causal relationship is clear: more gun ownership means more suicides.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=pmzHGpqThI8:JWEyvbnunAE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=pmzHGpqThI8:JWEyvbnunAE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=pmzHGpqThI8:JWEyvbnunAE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=pmzHGpqThI8:JWEyvbnunAE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/pmzHGpqThI8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Keith Clark (George Mason University) says Petry deserves to be in the pantheon of other great American writers like James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. \r\n\r\nLater in the show: In 1862, Poet Walt Whitman went to Fredericksburg, Virginia, searching for his brother George who had been wounded in a Civil War battle. Mara Scanlon and Brady Earnhart (University of Mary Washington) say Whitman was so moved by the carnage he found that he worked as a nurse for the rest of the war.

Hewitt says the changes taking place in China will affect the choices Americans make in managing their businesses and households.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=elSQFJriOeM:3DLPlqzSYwI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=elSQFJriOeM:3DLPlqzSYwI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=elSQFJriOeM:3DLPlqzSYwI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=elSQFJriOeM:3DLPlqzSYwI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/elSQFJriOeM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

            "description": "Before the Korean War, the bodies of American soldiers killed in conflicts abroad were buried in overseas cemeteries. But the nature of the conflict in Korea changed that. Brad Coleman (Virginia Military Institute) says the Korean War brought about other changes, too, including the development of forensic anthropology. And: For U.S. military veterans, the benefits claims process can be daunting. The Lewis B. Puller Jr. Veterans Benefits Clinic at the William & Mary Law School is making that process faster and has been touted as a model for the solution to the nation’s backlog of claims. Plus: Bootcamp can be funny. Comedy Bootcamp at the William & Mary Center for Veterans Engagement is a stand-up comedy class exclusively for veterans and servicemen, and it serves as an outlet for veterans with PTSD, TBI, and combat-related injuries.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: With its rolling green hills and its nearly 400,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is one of our nation’s most impressive military tributes. Also impressive is the work that goes on behind the scenes to create a meaningful experience for visitors. Debra Lattanzi Shutika (George Mason University) and Kerry Kaleba spent a month observing the inner workings of Arlington as part of the Field School for Cultural Documentation. Also featured: There are countless books on gardening and tree care. Joe Murray (Blue Ridge Community College) says some of the advice does more harm than good. Plus: From international competitions like the Van Cliburn to battles of high school marching bands, competition in music has become a way of life for aspiring musicians. Wayne Gallops (Radford University) says too much of it can stifle a young musician’s growth.<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=avbqWVZhCnw:CLwvckQiwt8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=avbqWVZhCnw:CLwvckQiwt8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=avbqWVZhCnw:CLwvckQiwt8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=avbqWVZhCnw:CLwvckQiwt8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/avbqWVZhCnw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Kevin Concannon (Virginia Tech), an expert on Ono’s work, notes she was an accomplished and innovative artist long before she met Lennon. Plus: A novel by Fred D’Aguiar (Virginia Tech) tells the story of a mother and daughter caught up in the tragic Jonestown mass suicide of 1978.\r\n\r\nLater in the show: Americans have been getting their kicks from Route 66 since John Steinbeck labeled it “The Mother Road” in The Grapes of Wrath. Michael Lund (Longwood University) is fascinated by the nostalgic small town life found along “America’s Main Street.” Lund is the author of a series of Route 66 novels. And: Jack Kerouac wrote about his travels along Route 66 in On the Road, the novel that made him a literary success. Gordon Ball (Virginia Military Institute) says Kerouac’s novel about the Beat Generation is as relevant today as it was in the 195<div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=xCtx8-YQNBo:8_hXkiUAEBY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=xCtx8-YQNBo:8_hXkiUAEBY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?a=xCtx8-YQNBo:8_hXkiUAEBY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/WithGoodReasonRadio?i=xCtx8-YQNBo:8_hXkiUAEBY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WithGoodReasonRadio/~4/xCtx8-YQNBo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
