We made up fictitious bans that a fictitious president was trying to enforce, all more ridiculous than the next. And our arguing for which law should stay versus which should go was purely entertaining the nature of the game and not based on any beliefs that we actually hold. We are very aware how difficult this weekend was for a LOT of people and very much hope you understand that we take it seriously. Humor for us is a familiar tactic we call on to deal with tough situations and that’s what this episode was for us. We love all of you and hope you got something positive from this week’s podcast game. See you next week.

She feels very strong about him and how he is very misunderstood person because of how he comes off.
