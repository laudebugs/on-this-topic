    "description": "This is the Torah Observant \"Shomer Mitzvot\" series.  In Judaism, safeguarding and keeping the Torah is central to performing the will of HaShem.  Indeed, as properly understood from HaShem’s point of view, the whole of Torah was given to bring its followers to the \"goal\" of acquiring the kind of faith in HaShem that leads to placing one’s trusting faithfulness in the One and only Son of HaShem, Yeshua HaMashiach.  To this end, the Torah has prophesied about him since as early as the book of Genesis (3:15), and continues to speak of him until its conclusion in Revelation (22:20). In this capacity, the Torah acts like its etymological counterpart \"yarah\"  (an archery term) in that it \"teaches\" its adherents how to properly identify with HaShem by helping them to \"reach the mark.” To be sure, one of the most common Hebrew verbs used to identify sin “chatah” literally means, \"to miss the mark.”",

            "description": "Anyone with a casual knowledge of the Apostle Paul (also known as Saul) and his writings on the Law of Moses would have to conclude that he is either the champion of “authentic Christian faith and liberty in Christ” or that he is a defender of Messianic Torah-based living, two ideals that seemingly oppose one another in these theologically-charged days in which we live.  Which statement would you regard as more accurate?\n\nA)\tPaul established historic Christianity on the freedom grounded in Jesus Christ, the only one to ever fulfill the Law of Moses, thus setting all believers free from any previous obligations to the old covenant and its ceremonies.\nB)\tPaul continued to establish and teach the Torah of Moshe as a viable and foundational way of life for Jews who embrace Messiah, as well as for Gentiles grafted into Isra'el via the exact same faith in the very same Messiah.\n\nWith confusion like this rampant in the Body of Messiah, how are we to uncover truth?\n\nIn a nutshell, what I attempt to get across to my audience is the idea that we as the historic church have miscast Paul and his 1st century Judaisms.  Basically, I am challenging 1500+ years of church history to show that Paul did not have any problem with Torah for the Gentiles per se (circumcision included).  Rather, he was on a mission to correct the mistaken notion that only Jews could be covenant members.  \n\nOnce a week, Tetze Torah Ministries conducts Live Internet Studies various biblical topics and questions.

            "description": "We are faced, then, with this challenge: we must seek to know Yeshua from the pages of Scripture without forcing an ontological template upon them. We cannot begin by asking the Greek questions of “essence and being” and then expect to find answers in the Hebraic-oriented text of the Bible. Rather, we must accept the fact that the identity and definition of God and the Messiah He has sent will be known in the Scriptures as we read of the work of God and His Messiah.  Or to put it another way: the language of the Bible will be properly understood only when we interpret it within the Hebrew worldview in which it was written.  \n\nThis will never satisfy the linear logic of the Greek mind. Nor will it work to use the categories of linear logic to describe the God of Israel. We must be satisfied with knowing and defining God and His Messiah by understanding and appreciating the work of God and what He has and will accomplish through it.\n\nLearn more about our Live Internet Studies:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/live-internet-studies\n\nFollow the ongoing 'Exploring the Shema' study on my personal Torah teaching website at this link:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/exploring-the-shema\n\nInformation about subscribing to my Weekly Messianic Newsletter:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/newsletter\n\nTetze Torah Ministries is a collection of Torah-based, Yeshua-focused written, audio, and video bible teachings by Torah Teacher Ariel ben-Lyman HaNaviy",

The role of God is as head over Yeshua and the role of the Ruach is as witness to Yeshua.  Yet the role of Yeshua is as witness of the Father and the role of the Spirit is as active agent of the Father as well. The part that brings it all together is when we remember that true worship belongs to God and God alone!  As such, whenever Yeshua or the Ruach is also worshipped we catch a glimpse of the “oneness” of the “three-ness” of God.\n\nLearn more about our Live Internet Studies:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/live-internet-studies\n\nFollow the ongoing 'Exploring the Shema' study on my personal Torah teaching website at this link:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/exploring-the-shema\n\nInformation about subscribing to my Weekly Messianic Newsletter:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/newsletter\n\nTetze Torah Ministries is a collection of Torah-based, Yeshua-focused written, audio, and video bible teachings by Torah Teacher Ariel ben-Lyman HaNaviy",

For example, we speak of the “being” of man—human being. A rock has “being”—the being of a rock, as does a cat, a dog, etc. Yet, we also know that there are personal attributes as well.

God is both “this” (seen) and “that” (unseen) at the same time.  Conversely, the historic Greek mindset from which Western thought also developed, approached God in concepts of “this” or “that,” i.e., he cannot be two simultaneously seemingly contradictory concepts at the same time (case in point: Yeshua cannot be God because God is an eternal being, while Yeshua was a finite human).  The tension created by affirming two seemingly contradictory concepts at the same time (a paradox) is referred to by some scholars as “Hebrew tension.”\n\nLearn more about our Live Internet Studies:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/live-internet-studies\n\nFollow the ongoing 'Exploring the Shema' study on my personal Torah teaching website at this link:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/exploring-the-shema\n\nInformation about subscribing to my Weekly Messianic Newsletter:\nhttp://www.tetzetorah.com/newsletter\n\nTetze Torah Ministries is a collection of Torah-based, Yeshua-focused written, audio, and video bible teachings by Torah Teacher Ariel ben-Lyman HaNaviy",
