Amanda Visek is a trained sport scientist-practitioner with active status on the United States Olympic Committee Sport Psychology and Mental Training Registry. As a sport scientist and Associate Professor at George Washington University, her research focus and applied practice has been making scientific advancements in our understanding of determinants of and barriers to children’s positive, fun sport experiences - the FUN MAPS. The FUN MAPS are scientific blueprints for promoting a culture of fun for children participating in organized athletics. \r\n\r\nIn this interview, Visek explains to Former PCA President Tina Syer ([@tinasyer4](https://twitter.com/tinasyer4)) how coaches can prioritize fun, the reason kids drop out of sports, misconceptions about fun in sports, and how fun is defined in her research.\r\n\r\nHighlights of the podcast include:\r\n\r\n- The #1 determinant for kids dropping out of sports is not having fun. \r\n- Fun is not only an important factor in youth sports, but it also continues to be in high school.\r\n- Fun not only keeps kids in sports, but enhances athletic performance and personal development. \r\n- Visek's definition of fun is identified by parents, coaches, and kids in the community. (There are over 80 fun \"determinants\", such as winning, trying hard, certain positive coaching techniques). These determinants make up the FUN MAPS. \r\n- Those FUN MAPS show 11 most common factors of fun: Games & Practices,  Learning & Improving, Trying Hard, Positive Team Dynamics, Team Friendship, Team Ritual, Gametime support, Positive Coaching, and \"swag\"\r\n- The three items that make the biggest difference in fun according to kids were Trying Hard, Positive Team Dynamics, and Positive Coaching.\r\n- How youth coaches can ensure a fun experience.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in viewing Visek's full research on fun, [click here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4201634/).\r\n",

Alyssa works with Megan Halmo and together they are part of a dynamic team leading Healthy Kids Out of School, an initiative of ChildObesity180 at Tufts University. Healthy Kids Out of School helps youth sports and extracurricular organizations create healthy programs for the children who participate.\r\n\r\nFormer PCA President Tina Syer ([@tinasyer4](https://twitter.com/tinasyer4)) met Alyssa at the National Coaching Conference in Seattle in July. In this podcast, Alyssa discusses her approach to developing healthy habits for youth athletes. Due to alarming statistics regarding childhood obesity in the United States (33% of children are obese, 80% of kids who are obese in their childhood will remain obese as adults) Alyssa explains why it is so important to develop healthy eating habits at a young age and stay active at practice.\r\n \r\nParents may be unaware that if a child does participate in youth sports, it does not necessarily mean that they are getting the recommended exercise or eating right. Alyssa has tips that coaches have shared with her for staying active in practice and getting the right amount of exercise: \r\n\r\n1) Breaking athletes into smaller groups for skill practices, eliminating long drill lines.\r\n\r\n2) Incorporating small sized skill games to keep everyone directly involved.\r\n\r\n3) Avoiding long lectures – kids should be playing more than standing.\r\n\r\nIt's also important that parents understand post-game meals. Parents should talk about this before the season starts so that post-game meals consist of fruits and vegetables rather than pizza, cupcakes, donuts or other unhealthy foods. If parents promote healthy eating and drinking water from a young age, kids naturally become accustomed to these habits.",

Tepper, who was quoted along with Thompson in Sports Illustrated's article [The Last Days of The Abusive Coach](http://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/09/29/end-abusive-coaches-college-football-basketball), argues that although some abusive coaches are successful, it’s never because they were abusive that they achieved success.

Bechtel, Jr. Foundation](http://sdbjrfoundation.org/) in July. In this podcast, Tough discusses two different \"toolboxes\" that help children succeed: the connection toolbox and the challenge toolbox.\r\n \r\nThe connection toolbox is one of warmth and empathy. According to Tough, motivation is often not centered on achievement, but by a desire for “connectedness” with a group, which coaches often can facilitate for their youth athletes.\r\n \r\nAlthough warmth and connection are important, it is equally important that  kids are given  appropriate challenges to overcome, as it is incredibly motivating for kids to see themselves improve. Tough calls this the challenge toolbox and urges coaches to give specific demands and direction to help athletes improve after inevitable mistakes and failures. Tough sees both toolboxes working effectively in tandem.\r\n\r\nOther highlights of the podcast include:\r\n\r\n- Being connected to a group and seeing yourself getting better at something are universally motivating for kids.\r\n\r\n- When adults change their behavior and use these two toolboxes, it can have a profound positive impact on the mental or emotional state of a kid.\r\n\r\n- When adults use these two toolboxes, it not only benefits the kid, but it also improves the adults' relationship with the kid, whether parent or coach. Tough calls this the \"virtuous cycle.\"\r\n",

To Fletcher, its important to stay curious and learn how to step into uncomfortable moments.\r\n\r\n\r\n- As a parent, the natural inclination is to step in and help your kid solve a problem.

His record at Davidson since taking the helm in 1989 through the 2014-2015 season is 495-299. However, there is much more to McKillop than numbers reveal.\r\n\r\nJim Thompson ([@JimThompson18](https://twitter.com/JimThompson18)), PCA Founder, talks to McKillop on his core coaching values of Commitment, Trust and Caring. He emphasizes the importance of coaches *showing* they care for their players as people, and he provides some very specific advice on how to do so.\r\n\r\nMcKillop also emphasizes the power of allying with players' parents. While many in college sports decry the increasing role and influence of players' parents, McKillop sees a proactive, positive relationship with parents as key to his team's culture and their shared effort to develop players and people of character. He draws on his experience with Curry's parents, Sonya and Dell Curry, as an example.\r\n\r\nOther important concepts explored here include coaching your own kids (as McKillop did with his son Matt, now an assistant coach for Davidson), and the \"Next Play\" mantra he \"stole\" from Coach K to help move his players past their mistakes and living and playing in the moment.\r\n\r\nLike what you hear?

He has done 40 years of research on connections between sports, culture and society, much of that focused on the play, games and sport participation of young people. His *Sports in Society: Issues and Controversies*(11th edition) is the world's most widely used sports sociology text.\r\n\r\nJim Thompson ([@JimThompson18](https://twitter.com/JimThompson18)), PCA Founder, talks to Coakley about phenomena of sports sociology.  Coakley discusses how public support for a team, or an individual team member's behavior, is more accepted when that team is winning.  He also talks about how unfair it is to put children on a traveling team and compel specialization at a young age, when they haven’t even developed or discovered if they want to play the sport at that level.  Specialization can be truly damaging to a kid, and it also creates a culture where there isn’t a place for kids who don’t want to specialize.  Coakley urges parents to consider how to best involve their child in sports for their development. Here's where you'll find Coakley talking about featured topics:\r\n\r\n- **Specialization**- 20:30, 23:50\r\n- **Injury**- 26:10\r\n- **Mistakes**- 18:18, 31:40\r\n\r\nLike what you hear?
