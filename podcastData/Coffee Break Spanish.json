            "description": "<p>Every 30th September, the podcasting world comes together to celebrate podcasting on International Podcast Day. We're celebrating today by saying thank you to the Coffee Break community in this special podcast episode. International Podcast Day aims to raise awareness about podcasts and gives podcast creators and listeners a chance to&nbsp;celebrate the medium and the podcast industry.</p><p><br></p><p>But podcasting has been around for a lot longer than that! Back in 2004, broadcaster Adam Curry asked developer Dave Winer to develop an audioblogging system and without going into the technical side of things, or indeed who specifically “invented” podcasting, it was Curry and Winer who got the ball rolling. The word “podcast” however, was first mentioned in a newspaper article in the Guardian by technology reporter Ben Hammersley. It was declared Word of the Year by the New Oxford American Dictionary in 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, at this stage Coffee Break hadn't yet launched, but Coffee Break host Mark did start podcasting for an education project he was running at the time called Partners in Excellence or “PiE”, and The PiEcast was used to bring a community of learners together and help them develop their language skills. Mark quickly realised that podcasting was the perfect medium for publishing language lessons, and for sharing his passion for languages with a wider audience.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Coffee Break Spanish was launched in October 2006. As the very first Spanish podcast for beginners on iTunes, it quickly gathered an audience and learners around the world started learning with us. Since then we’ve gone on to produce Coffee Break French, German, Italian, Chinese, Swedish and English and we have plans to develop more Coffee Break languages in the future. We’ve also created shorter podcast series called One Minute Languages covering over 30 languages from Arabic to Zulu.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We’ve published well over 1,000 episodes across the different languages and&nbsp;our podcasts have been downloaded over 290 million times, and we currently deliver over 2 million free language lessons every month to a community of Coffee Break learners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So that’s why today, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you, our podcast listeners, our Coffee Break community. Without you there wouldn’t be any Coffee Break! Thank you for choosing to listen to our shows, to learn with us and to share your 15 or 20 minute coffee break with me and my cohosts on each episode of the show.</p><p><br></p><p>Now just before we finish, a couple of important points: if you’d like to hear about the latest episodes and series from Coffee Break, make sure you join Mark on Sunday 4th October at 4pm UK time / 11am Eastern / 8am Pacific for a live broadcast on YouTube and our Facebook pages. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaRFFGd3MB4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">You can go straight to our YT channel - Coffee Break Languages</a> - and click the “Set Reminder” button.</p><p><br></p><p>And, if you’d like to help us celebrate International Podcast Day, why not simply tell a language-loving friend about what you’ve learned with our podcasts and help us grow the Coffee Break community even further?</p><p><br></p><p>Merci beaucoup - vielen, vielen Dank, muchísimas gracias, grazie molte, xiè xie nimen, tack så jättemycket and thank you! There’s lots more coming from Coffee Break and we hope you continue to enjoy learning with us. Happy International Podcast Day!</p> &#10;&nbsp;<br /><hr><p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '>See <a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'>acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p>",

In the audio episode we’ll listen to a spoken version of that text. We’ll be publishing the free preview episodes of the course here on the site, on iTunes and on Soundcloud. The preview episodes include an introduction from Mark and Carmen, the audio of the text and then a summary of the text in English to help learners understand.</p><p>Our premium materials for Season 4 include the following elements:</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>the full audio lesson</strong>: running to around 30 minutes, this episode analyses the text and Mark and Carmen will discuss&nbsp;the grammar points and idiomatic expressions&nbsp;featured in the text, helping you to understand with further examples;</li><li><strong>a transcript of the lesson</strong>: if you didn’t quite catch what the presenters said&nbsp;in Spanish in the episode, you’ll be able to follow the transcript and use the handy notes to help you fully understand;</li><li><strong>bonus audio lesson</strong>:&nbsp;we’re also providing an&nbsp;extra episode which will test you on your translation skills.</li></ul><p>Episode one will be published on Wednesday 28th January at 6:00pm UK time.

Alba has recently had a bad experience in a tapas restaurant in Scotland, compared with her normal experiences of tapas in Spain. Mark and Alba talk about different tapas and their experience of eating Spanish food in Spain and elsewhere. Language points covered include <em>ojalá</em>, the word <em>cobrar</em> and <em>si</em> clauses. In this week’s <em>intermedio</em>, José introduces a couple of phrases which help you disagree with people emphatically.

            "description": "<p>It’s five years since we launched the first lesson of Coffee Break Spanish, and since then we’ve served up millions of language lessons to learners around the world through our podcasts, our enhanced lessons and our ebooks. We’re delighted today to announce five new courses, and we’ll also be letting you know about a few exciting projects which are due to be launched early in 2012.</p><p><br></p><p>Spanish</p><p>¡Empecemos con el español! On the 18th October 2006 we began with Spanish, and we’re doing the same today. Today we’re delighted to launch a brand new Spanish show. When you’re learning a language on your own, or if you don’t have access to a teacher or a native speaker, it’s difficult to get the answers you need to help you make progress. We receive questions almost every day from learners through posts on the website, emails, voicemails, tweets and Facebook, and we decided that the best way to deal with all of these questions would be to launch Q&amp;A Spanish: you ask the questions and we provide the answers. Q&amp;A Spanish will be hosted by teacher and languages expert JP Villanueva and native Spanish speaker Nahyeli Mendivil, so you have the best of both worlds! Each week they’ll help you develop your confidence in Spanish further by providing tips and examples of Spanish vocabulary, usage and grammar. Q&amp;A Spanish starts today, so you can already subscribe to the podcast. <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/shows/spanish/qa-spanish/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to find out more</a> about how you can take part in the show.</p><p><br></p><p>French</p><p>We’re also delighted to be announcing a brand new French video show. In On Location French you can join Sophie who is a UK student currently studying in Paris. She’s there for a year and she’s agreed to be our “correspondent”, bringing us weekly reports on interesting expressions she learns as she interacts with native speakers every day. Sophie will also be providing some cultural input as she gets to know the city, and we’re really looking forward to finding out more about her experiences in Paris in her weekly videoblog. Find out more and watch the episodes at the <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/shows/french/on-location-french/\" target=\"_blank\">On Location French</a> page.</p><p><br></p><p>Dutch, Flemish and Arabic</p><p>We’re delighted to be launching three new courses in our ever-popular One Minute Languages series. One of the most requested languages over the past few years has been Dutch, and we’ve decided to produce a Dutch and Flemish version of the course. Both languages are very similar – Flemish is the variety of Dutch spoken in Belgium, and of course Dutch is spoken in the Netherlands and in other countries around the world such as Suriname and Aruba. <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/category/shows/oml-dutch/\" target=\"_blank\">One Minute Dutch</a> launches on Thursday 20th October and <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/category/shows/oml-flemish/\" target=\"_blank\">One Minute Flemish</a> will be published on Fridays from 21st October. We’ve also been asked many times to produce an Arabic version of our One Minute Languages course. <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/category/shows/oml-arabic/\" target=\"_blank\">One Minute Arabic</a> will run for ten weeks from tomorrow, Wednesday 19th October. We’re concentrating on Modern Standard Arabic which will ensure that as a learner you’ll be understood across the Arab world, from Casablanca to Kuwait. With these latest additions to the One Minute Languages series, we now cover 26 languages, from Arabic to Zulu making Radio Lingua your first stop for language-learning on the go, literally from A to Z!</p><p><br></p><p>What’s coming down the line?</p><p>There may be some of you who are looking forward to a third season of Coffee Break Spanish. We’re working on this at the moment and by the time the reruns of Show Time Spanish end in January we should be ready to go with <strong>Coffee Break Spanish Season 3</strong>. French learners will be very pleased to know that Pierre-Benoît has been wandering about in the... &#10;&nbsp;<br /><hr><p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '>See <a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'>acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p>",

This show was a bit different from the other Spanish learning shows out there: it was a gradual introduction to basic Spanish presented by teacher Mark, teaching student Kara. At this stage no-one really knew if the idea would work, but <strong>Coffee Break Spanish</strong> grew to become one of the most popular ways to learn Spanish online. The show quickly climbed the charts on iTunes UK and US, and began to feature in the top podcasts at <a href=\"http://www.podcastalley.com\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast Alley</a> and on <a href=\"http://www.libsyn.com\" target=\"_blank\">Libsyn</a>.</p><p>Three years down the line and the Radio Lingua Network now produces twenty-seven language courses in eighteen languages and this week saw the sixty millionth download of our language lessons! That means – on average – around 55,000 downloads per day, every day for the last three years.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s time to celebrate!</p><p>To celebrate this milestone in our company’s development, we’re reducing everything to 60% of the normal prices, ie. 40% off, for one week only, from noon GMT on 18th October through to midnight GMT on 25th October. There has never been a better time to purchase our lesson guides, enhanced podcasts and extra listening materials. Simply use coupon code <strong>sixty</strong> when you sign up for any of our shows.

By purchasing a membership you can access a range of materials including pdf lesson guides featuring the words and phrases included in each lesson, enhanced podcasts which are perfect for listening on the iPod Touch or iPhone where you can see the flashcards synchronised to the audio, and bonus listening materials to help you improve your language skills even more.</p><p>Please note that the coupon code can’t be used in conjunction with any other offer and is limited to one purchase per member.

We can’t offer retrospective discounts if the coupon code was not used.</p><p><br></p><p>Announcing a new development</p><p>We’ve been reading your comments regarding discussion boards and building a community around our lessons. Our previous discussion boards were created before we developed our membership system, so were unfortunately not linked to the system. Today we’re launching our new <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/community/\" target=\"_blank\">Community</a> area where listeners can interact with each other, share their language-learning experiences and benefit from collaborative learning with fellow listeners. Accessing the Community is free, but you’ll need to sign up for an account in our system, so we’ll hopefully avoid the spam problems we’ve had in the past.</p><p>If you’re already a member of our system then you’ll be able to access <a href=\"http://radiolingua.com/community/viewforum.php?f=7\" target=\"_blank\">My Courses</a> in the community, where we’ll lead activities and generate discussions in which you can practise what you’ve learned in each lesson. My Courses is restricted to our premium members, so if you’ve purchased a Season Pass to Coffee Break French Level 2, you’ll see this course in My Courses, allowing you to interact with your fellow learners in the activities and discussions there. And if you’re not yet a premium member, you can join this week at a hugely discounted price!
