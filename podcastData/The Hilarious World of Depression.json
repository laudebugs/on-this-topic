    "description": "A show about clinical depression... with laughs? Well, yeah. Depression is an incredibly common and isolating disease experienced by millions, yet often stigmatized by society. The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with this disease, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they've dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way. If you have not met the disease personally, it's almost certain that someone you know has, whether it's a friend, family member, colleague, or neighbor. Depression is a vicious cycle of solitude and stigma that leaves people miserable and sometimes dead. Frankly, we’re not going to put up with that anymore. The Hilarious World of Depression is not medical treatment and should not be seen as a substitute for therapy or medication. But it is a chance to gain some insight, have a few laughs, and realize that people with depression are not alone and that together, we can all feel a bit better. The Hilarious World of Depression is made possible by a grant from HealthPartners’ and its Make It Okay campaign which works to reduce the stigma of mental health. www.makeitok.org",

People with actual depression know better and appreciate films that show the truth. In this episode, our listeners, the beloved THWoD-balls, give their picks, ranging from sci-fi to historical drama to comedy. We got moon men, bridesmaids, a couple of hobbits, and even a Babadook.

But it didn’t feel all that swanky to Baron Vaughn when he was holed up in a Vancouver apartment for days at a time, eating Cheerios and bathing in Dawn dish soap, all as a result of a severe attack of the depression that had been chasing him down for years. Baron shares those moments and how he got out of them as well as tales of being raised by his great grandparents in a small New Mexico town, dealing with the after-effects of his mother’s addiction, and how depression is perceived and ignored among black Americans.</p>\n\n      ",
