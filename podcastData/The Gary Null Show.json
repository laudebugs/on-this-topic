            "description": "<p><strong>Simple, Effective Natural Ways to Maintain a Healthy Respiratory System</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Progressive Radio Network, March 31, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A hallmark of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is that it infects the upper respiratory tract accompanied by shortness of breath, a chronic cough and frequently chills, fever and fatigue. However, these are symptoms similar but not limited to many other viral infections, including other strains of CoV, avian and swine flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), picornaviruses, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The conventional war chest for arming ourselves against respiratory infections are drugs that can lessen the severity of these symptoms and hopefully will kill the virus to prevent it from worsening.  But pharmaceutical medications are not the only recourse we can rely upon. There are non-toxic supplements, medicinal botanicals and common sense actions people can adopt to protect themselves. Consequently, even if infected by COVID-19 or another respiratory virus, our immune system can be strengthened naturally to dramatically reduce the risks of serious complications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the moment, the primary dispensers of information about the pandemic is the White House, the CDC, the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The mainstream media and state and local health officials have been completely relying upon comments and reports from these sources to inform or education the public.  However, what is not being communicated are the clinical experiences and scientific advice from around the world that contain valuable information and analyses to share. In China, Europe, Japan, and the US there are tens of thousands or more physicians and medical professionals using alternative modalities such as nutritional therapy, naturopathy and Traditional Chinese Medicine to further protect patients from respiratory infections alongside or to complement conventional drug protocols. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Unfortunately none of these non-conventional doctors and professionals are being asked for their consultation nor is the large body of scientific literature that supports their regimens being recommended. We are referring to studies published in respected journals and research conducted by important centers of medical investigation.  The question, therefore, is why has a contingent of people on the frontlines of prevention and complementary approaches to health been completely marginalized from the community of so-called \"experts\" who dominate the voices in the media? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Therefore we want to share simple natural ways to protect your respiratory system and lungs during this stressful period. None of this information is folk tales but rather it is based on research found in the National Library of Medicine and other professional medical sources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Unfortunately, being cooped up indoors for long extended periods of time has its own health risks. It has been shown extensively that indoor air usually has higher concentrations of toxins than outdoor air. Aside from the psychological effects of isolation, it adversely affects our immune system. People who spend too much time indoors readily become Vitamin D deficient, which is essential for immune protection to avoid contracting infections. It also disrupts our natural circadian rhythms thereby contributing to poor sleep patterns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For the large majority of people, our homes and apartments are ridden with allergens, dust, molds and various fungi and cold-like causing germs. It is </span><a href=\"https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-indoor-toxins/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">estimated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that most Americans have anywhere between 400 to 800 chemicals stored in their bodies and these are often hoarded in fat cells. Of course, poorly ventilated homes are far more dangerous. Furthermore, many of our every-day house-hold products contain numerous chemical toxins and irritants such as volatile organic compounds (VOC), heavy metals, PBDEs or flame retardants, phthalates and Bisphenol A that are commonly used in all plastics, etc.  VOCs are found in aerosol products, dry cleaned clothing, paints and varnishes, floor wax, spot removers and air fresheners. All of these chemicals can vaporize easily thereby further polluting indoor air quality. The same is true for pesticides that we might have in our homes. Ozone can damage the lungs and can contribute to shortness of breath and coughs. Although the majority of ozone is outdoors, </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/publications/books/housing/cha05.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">according to the CDC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, it can accumulate indoors to as much 80% of outdoor levels.  For this reason, maintaining a healthy level of humidity is critical for reducing various pathogens and periodically keeping windows open for a period of time to air out rooms is highly recommended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sunlight not only increases our level of Vitamin D, which is essential for immune protection; it also raises serotonin levels that can boost our moods. This finding was </span><a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20021205/unraveling-suns-role-in-depression\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">confirmed by researchers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> at the Baker Research Institute in Australia and published in </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Lancet</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Low serotonin, especially during winter months, has been associated with Seasonal Affective Disorder, which is </span><a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder#1\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">characterized</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> by depression, fatigue, and a lack of concentration. And of course, these effects have been shown to adversely affect our immune system. Therefore, making frequent efforts to get outdoors, while maintaining social distancing, not only raises our spirits but also helps clear our respiratory system from allergens and pollutants that accumulate indoors.  </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494409000838\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A series of studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> conducted by the University of Rochester found that being outdoors increased both physical and mental vitality. Getting a sufficient amount of outdoor exposure is one of the surest natural ways to cleanse our lungs. Other methods include steam therapy (inhaling water vapor) and exercise to clear airways and drain mucus from the bronchia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There are also plenty of foods, herbs and even supplements that can protect the lungs and keep the nasal and respiratory passages clear. Water is absolutely essential for maintaining health lungs since dry lungs result in irritation that increases the risks for infection. Also following the Mediterranean diet has been shown by </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7754995\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">epidemiologists at Harvard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> to have protective effects for allergic respiratory diseases, largely due to the high intake of olive oil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Potassium is a vital mineral for proper lung function. It is not uncommon for people who are </span><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/diet-nutrition\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">deficient in potassium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> to experience sporadic breathing problems. Therefore including potassium rich foods in daily meals, such as avocados, dark leafy greens, tomatoes, beets, bananas and oranges, can raise and sustain healthy potassium levels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Several studies have shown that apples can improve lung function. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10639525\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> out of St. George's Hospital Medical School in London followed over 2,500 individuals between the ages of 45 and 59. Among the various vitamins and foods consumed, Vitamin E and apples were the most effective for slowing the decline in lung function. For people with a history of asthma, apples, which are rich in flavonoids, are </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12936923\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">inversely linked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> with asthma, decreased bronchial hypersensitivity, and positively improved general pulmonary health. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324932#health-benefits\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Celery contains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> two important antioxidants -- apigenin and luteolin -- that have both been associated with reducing inflammation associated with our nasal passages and lungs. It has been shown to be particularly beneficial for those who have allergies that can hinder respiration. Of course it is important to know whether or not you have a rare allergy to celery itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In an earlier article, we reported on the health benefits of nitric oxide as a signaling molecule to strength our immune system's response to invasion. One of the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425174/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">best sources</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> for increasing nitric oxide levels in addition to improved endothelial cell function by decreasing oxidative stress are red beets. Most of our respiratory passageways -- from our nasal cavity to our bronchi -- are lined with epithelium   . Our lungs, on the other hand, are lined with a simple squamous epithelium or \"goblet cells\". Beets are one important food that protects these cells to maintain the health of our entire respiratory system. Beets have also been </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682333\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">shown by researchers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> at Southern Methodist University to help prevent common cold symptoms, especially during periods of increased psychological stress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Green Tea and quercetin can promote healthy lungs due to their antioxidant properties. Both act as natural antihistamines that reduce respiratory irritation and inflammation. A study of 1,000 adults conducted by the medical school at Kyung Hee University in South Korea found that participants who drank two cups of green tea per day had better respiratory function than those who didn't drink any. Japanese Matcha tea has been investigated and found to be </span><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/matcha-green-tea\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a more powerful antioxidant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> than regular green teas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One can conclude that having a daily juice compromised of fresh apples, celery, beets and garlic -- which contains the powerful antimicrobial biomolecule allicin that </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6151386/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">kills human lung pathogenic bacteria</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> -- can have an enormous impact on cleansing and protecting our lungs. Matcha tea can be purchased as powders and also added to your daily juice. It is our opinion that following this guideline along with getting sufficient outdoor exposure, exercise, reducing sources of toxicity in the home and proper ventilation, and drinking green tea and supplementing with quercetin, Vitamins C and D and other foods rich in antioxidants is a very simple and effective way of sustaining maximal lung health to get us through the pandemic. </span></p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Lessons from the Fear of Coronavirus</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Richard Gale and Gary Null, PhD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Progressive Radio Network, March 27, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The worldwide coronavirus pandemic has provided an opportunity for everybody to take stock of their lives and reevaluate their priorities. It is also forcing us to pay attention to the fundamental basics for becoming responsible for our own health. These very basic principles are the same ones that may have saved countless lives in the past from avoidable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and other infectious disease outbreaks.  Hopefully as a people and as a nation we will emerge wiser and act more proactively in the future from the lessons learned during this crisis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, our ability to evolve beyond our limited perceptions of ourselves, our personal health and the successes and failures of America's health system are dependent upon the information we receive. If what we are being told by those in authority is inaccurate or patently false, such as Donald Trump's chloroquine drug as \"a gift from God\" to treat coronavirus infections or prescribing HIV retroviral drugs without clearly stating these drugs' serious health warnings, then the citizenry remains in a daze of ignorance and uninformed. Worse, the nation becomes further deluded, and, as we are observing, this leads to panic and fear. Panic in turn brings forth its own set of economic, social and personal problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As we follow the events unfolding both in the US and globally, it is understandable that the medical community continues to be very perplexed on many issues. It is </span><a href=\"https://www.naturalblaze.com/2020/03/research-group-based-at-oxford-university-stops-using-who-data-for-coronavirus-reporting-citing-errors.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">not a good sign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> when Oxford University made the decision to cease relying on the World Health Organization's coronavirus data because of the consistency in errors. Throughout the world, nations' health ministries rely on WHO's reports to develop their own strategies. Stanford University biomedical data scientist Dr. John Ioannidas </span><a href=\"https://greenmedinfo.com/blog/fiasco-making-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-rel\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">recently warned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that we sorely \"lack reliable evidence on how many people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who continue to become infected,\" and the data collected so far is \"utterly unreliable.\" Many countries, which include the US, Ioannidas says are consequently adopting \"draconian countermeasures\" to deal with the spread of the virus. He also called the WHO's data and \"reported case fatality rates\" as \"meaningless.\"  Due to our failure to properly confront the virus, death rates are \"buried within the noise of the estimate of deaths from influenza-like illness.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Although coronavirus is a common infection and there are dozens of strains, this is a novel strain that has only been with us for less than 5 months. We know it is highly infectious. </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6909e1.htm#contribAff\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There is evidence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that it may be more contagious via contact with surfaces rather than from airborne particles between persons. </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/how-long-coronavirus-lasts-on-surfaces-packages-groceries\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For example</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> the CDC discovered that COVID-19 viral RNA was found on the surfaces of a cruise ship for 17 days after the passengers departed. And infectious rates appear to be quite erratic. Some countries have been very successful to contain its spread, while others including Italy, Spain and the US are not doing very well. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea1p1eevcfo\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">During a recent interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, one of our greatest intellectuals Noam Chomsky remarked that our nation's intrastructure has taken on \"a third world character.\"  But it is not only our crumbling roads and bridges and our banana republic transportation system that has become a disgrace for a wealthy nation that claims to be exceptional. \"Our healthcare,\" Chomsky continues, \"is an international scandal.\"  It too is part of America's infrastructure but has become \"unbelievably backwards.\" Healthcare workers and nurses are pleading for essential supplies such as effective face masks. Hospitals have shortages of hospital beds and respirators. There are insufficient chemicals on hand to manufacture enough diagnostic tests; and this is critical to properly monitor the spread of the virus. Unlike other countries, notably South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and even China, our healthcare system has been reduced to \"economy and efficiency\";  we only produce what we require at the moment and give no forethought towards the future. Prevention has never been one of America's stronger skills. We do nothing until the next tsunami or Katrina moment hits us unexpectedly. In the wake of our habitual unpreparedness, numerous people suffer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So as the nation applauds Dr. Anthony Fauci at the CDC and continues to drink the kool aid served by the mainstream press to have us believe our federal health agencies are heroically on top of the situation, we must ask why the US was so far behind the eight ball in the first place. And in the absence of a federal health system that should be worthy of a developed nation, how can people better protect their personal health from infection and potential inflammatory complications?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Aside from all the uncertainty and confusion, even among our top health experts, one thing we can feel certain about: those at greatest risk have other pre-existing medical conditions. Unfortunately, our health officials have not provided any clear demographic statistics of those who have died in the US so far.  What percent had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular or autoimmune illnesses? The condition of a person's immune system is critical for fighting any infectious disease, not just the coronavirus. The vitality of the immune system can mean life or death. The Italian government, on the other hand, </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says?fbclid=IwAR2PVA8lJJsduXllEmixWhz74DlQDgIbgDNDgQztBTHF0tt8Yorb93gVipM\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">provided such a report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Over 99 percent (99.2%) of Italians who died from either the virus or a subsequent co-infection such pneumonia, had a pre-existing health condition. Almost 50 percent had three or more conditions, the most common being high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease.  The median age of infection is 63 years old and 79.5 years is the median for the mortality rate. All those who had died under 40 years of age were \"males with serious existing medical conditions.\" </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, in the US and parts of Europe, the crisis seems to be unfolding differently.  Fauci recently stated during a White House meeting, \"Now we have to look at the young people who are getting seriously ill from the European cohort and make sure that it isn't just driven by that they have underlying conditions because... all bets are off no matter how young you are if you have an underlying, serious medical condition.\" For example, in both Italy and Spain where infection rates are inordinately high, approximately 30 percent of males smoke. In the US, recent data shows that 40 percent of hospitalized cases are between 20 and 54 and 12 percent of persons in intensive care are between 20 and 44 years of age.  </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/health_policy/adult_chronic_conditions.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Furthermore according to the CDC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, 78 percent of Americans over 55 have a chronic condition and over 47 percent have two. </span><a href=\"https://www.focusforhealth.org/chronic-illnesses-and-the-state-of-our-childrens-health/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">American children</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> are some of the sickest in the developed world -- 27 percent had a chronic illness a decade ago not including obesity. Much of the cause of American's chronically ill children is due to environmental reasons. Many of these conditions would be preventable if we had a satisfactory healthcare system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nevertheless, the Italian message is clear.  In addition to the conventional preventative measures being undertaken -- quarantine, social distancing, reducing face to face encounters, properly cleaning surfaces, protective gloves and masks -- people need to be educated in ways to strengthen their immune systems. This requires convincing people to be more conscious about the risks of poor diets and unhealthy lifestyle habits. However, changing the consciousness of a society is extraordinarily difficult. And so far, our government and state health officials have been completely ignoring this critical factor as one solution to lessen the serious viral infections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So if the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/us-may-become-centre-of-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">World Health Organization warns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that the US \"may become the next center for the coronavirus pandemic,\" should we be that surprised?  Yet we mustn't permit fear to overwhelm us into complacency. Catastrophes, crises and tragedies are often a necessary trumpet blasts to wake up, review our lives, our habits and false assumptions. The coronavirus pandemic is such a time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Earlier we released an article about the preventative measures we can take to both support our immune system to lessen the impact of viral infections, such as the coronavirus and flu, or to recover more rapidly in the event we experience symptoms.  Since then we have learned about other natural approaches to further protect ourselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Recently Zhejiang University School of Medicine, one China's oldest and most prestigious universities, publicly released its \"Handbook of CoVid-19 Prevention and Treatment\" worldwide. Having been the first on the front lines against the new strain, and having gone through the deadly SARS coronavirus epidemic over a dozen years ago, it is one of the most concise documents for healthcare measures to prevent and contain the spread of the virus. The medical researchers identify many important clues that are barely found in English speaking literature. For example </span><a href=\"https://www.alibabacloud.com/universal-service/pdf_reader?spm=a3c0i.14138300.8102420620.dreadnow.6df3647fwOGXRJ&pdf=Handbook_of_COVID_19_Prevention_en_Mobile.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">the report notes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> the importance of nutrition and the use of probiotics to strengthen infected patients' microbiome. According to the report, \"the intestinal microecological balance is broken in COVID-19 patients.... Intestinal microecological imbalance may lead to bacterial translocation and secondary infection.\" Therefore, the Chinese scientists conclude that it is important to maintain a balance in the body's microecology through nutritional support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The report is also clear in warning about Trump's erroneous claims about chloroquine's safety and lists the adverse effects including cardiac arrest and ocular toxicity. In China chloroquine is not being prescribed unless a patient has had an electrocardigram performed. None of this was noted during Trump's press conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition to conventional treatments, the Zheijiang scientists list herbal formulas based upon Traditional Chinese Medicine studies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Therefore we are summarizing what we presented earlier along with additional new information.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Unlike the US, most of the world, especially in Asia and continental Europe, recognizes Vitamin C as an important anti-viral agent. It is also a remarkable antioxidant shown to ward off infections. There is a large body of research to support Vitamin C's efficacy during cold seasons. At this moment, China is conducting several clinical trials with intravenous Vitamin C to treat patients infected with the Covid19 strain. The city government of Shanghai is now actively treating patients with intravenous Vitamin C. A trial at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan is using 24,000 mg per day intravenously. The Wuhan study can be viewed on the US National Library of Medicine's website here: </span><a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In 2017 the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28353648\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">University of Helsinki</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> reviewed 148 studies that indicated Vitamin C may alleviate or prevent infections caused by bacteria and viruses. The most extensive indication studied was the common cold. Among people who are physically active, Vitamin C was most beneficial. However, many studies relied on very low Vitamin C doses, which likely contributed to the minor benefits observed. Some of these were as low as 100 mg daily. In addition, the studies showed that colds' duration was frequently shorter and less severe among people with sufficient Vitamin C levels.  </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7814237\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">An early randomized double blind trial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> to investigate Vitamin C's ability to protect elderly hospitalized patients from acute respiratory infections was conducted at Hudderfield University in the UK. The study relied on a very low dose of 200 mg per day. Nevertheless, those who received the vitamin fared significantly better than those taking placebo.  There was </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10543583\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">another controlled placebo study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> involving 715 students between the ages 18-32 taking 1000 mg four times daily. The test group had an 85% decrease in flu and cold symptoms compared to the control. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Barely a week goes by without another study appearing in the peer-reviewed literature that looks at either Vitamin D's therapeutic characteristics or the risks of Vitamin D deficiency. A high number of otherwise healthy adults have been reported to have low levels of vitamin D, mostly at the end of the Winter season. Deficiency rates vary between 42% for the entire population to 82% for Black Americans and 63% for Latinos. People who are housebound, institutionalized and those who work night shifts are most likely to be vitamin D deficient.

One cytokine in particular, NLRP3, was earlier discovered to be associated with SARS-CoV infections.  Since children's melatonin levels are at their peak up until puberty , this may be one reason why coronvirus infections in children under 9 are typically very mild or show no symptoms at all. Is this perhaps a reason </span><a href=\"https://www.evolutamente.it/covid-19-pneumonia-inflammasomes-the-melatonin-connection/?fbclid=IwAR3sgmOIwwsIxg2GTuGQJDVOJ9EwPP5vBtH6K3Qe3sdKC74QpOAqkaC9T6w\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">why infected pregnant mothers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> admitted to Wuhan University's hospital gave birth to babies free of the virus?  As we increasingly age, the more rapidly our natural melatonin levels drop off. Melatonin has the unique property of inhibiting NLRP3 elevations after viral infection. For this reason, the amino acid can prevent NLRP3 cytokine storms contributing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) that are characteristic with severe COVID-19 cases. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Nitric Oxide</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule found throughout the body that has been associated with improved vasodilatation, the regulation of cellular life and death, and to strengthen the immune system's responses.  Like melatonin, newborns have very high levels of nitric oxide in their paranasal passages which provides added immunity unseen in the large majority of adults. Nitric oxide moreover </span><a href=\"https://www.evolutamente.it/covid-19-pneumonia-inflammasomes-the-melatonin-connection/?fbclid=IwAR3sgmOIwwsIxg2GTuGQJDVOJ9EwPP5vBtH6K3Qe3sdKC74QpOAqkaC9T6w\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">inhibits NLRP3 cytokine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> activation. This is another reason why Vitamin C supplementation is so important because the vitamin supports the body's production of nitric oxide.  There is also evidence that nitric oxide is very effective against coronavirus. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544093/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Dr. Sara Akerstrom</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and colleagues at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and the Karolinska Institute discovered that nitric oxide \"specifically inhibits the replication cycle of SARS CoV, most probably during the early stages of infection.\" </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234326\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">An earlier study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> conducted by the University of Leuven in Belgium noticed nitric oxide inhibited SARS coronavirus cell infection in vitro. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The best source for increasing our body's nitric oxide levels is through foods. Beets are particularly effective and can boost NO levels within 45 minutes. Other excellent NO sources are dark chocolate, rhubarb (which has the highest levels of nitrates), leafy greens, pomegranate and foods high in Vitamin C.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Zinc</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many of us are already aware that zinc supplements can ward off and reduce the onset of colds and flu-like symptoms.

When the lungs are subject to serious oxidative stress, there is an increase in inflammatory cytokines that play a role in different respiratory infections including influenza, coronavirus, echovirus, adenovirus, coxsackie virus and others. Therefore, certain antioxidants can alleviate lung damage due to oxidative stress. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Colloidal Silver</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nanoparticle or colloidal silver has been studied extensively for its anti-bacterial properties but less so for infectious viruses. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6264685/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Most studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> for silver's antiviral activities have focused on HIV-1, Hepatitis B, herpesvirus and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In a 2005 issue of the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Journal of Nanotechnology</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, the University of Texas and Mexico University observed that silver nanoparticles could kill HIV-1 within 3 hours, and they suspected that this may be true for many other viruses as well. However, this conclusion may be too premature and more research is necessary. There are studies showing silver's efficacy against respiratory viruses. One large study by Japan's </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">National Defense Medical College Research Institute</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, published in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Journal of Molecular Sciences</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, recommended that Japanese healthcare workers take nanosilver to protect them from viruses including coronavirus. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Then a joint study by Deakin University in Australia and Osaka University in Japan found that colloidal silver significantly protected cells from H3N2 flu infection and prevented viral growth in the lungs </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>BOTANICALS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Astragulus</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronaviral infections belong to a specific epidemic disease category. Astragulus is not only a very popular plant used in TCM, but it is also one of the most researched and promising botanical plants shown to have antiviral properties. In both TCM and Ayruveda medicinal formulas astrugulus has been prescribed for centuries because of its effectiveness against infections and over-stressed respiratory conditions. Compounds, </span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoguang_Wang9/publication/261442961_Prevention_and_treatment_of_viral_respiratory_infections_by_traditional_Chinese_herbs/links/56b23b1d08ae56d7b06cae22/Prevention-and-treatment-of-viral-respiratory-infections-by-trad\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">notably saponins</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, found in astragulus have been well researched and found to hinder influenza proliferation. The US Department of Agriculture's Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory found it inhibits avian flu viruses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Jinlin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170045\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">conducted a study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> published in the journal </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Microbiological Pathology</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that concluded </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"Astragulus exhibits antiviral properties that can treat infectious bronchitis caused by [avian] coronavirus\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A month ago, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine completed an analysis of previous research looking at the benefits of Chinese herbal formulas against the SARS coronavirus and H1N1 flu (swine flu). In 3 studies, among participants who took formulas against SARS, none contracted the illness. Nor did any contract H1N1 influenza in four additional studies. A primary ingredient in these formulas' was astragulus. Earlier in February, researchers at Beijing Children's Hospital at the Capital Medical University provided a thorough overview of recommended diagnostic procedures and treatments for specific symptoms witnessed in the current Covid19 infections that included both allopathic and traditional Chinese medicine.  In cases where there are signs of severe weakness and stress observed in the lungs and spleen, a formula called Liu Jun Zi is being prescribed, which includes astragulus, skullcap and ginseng as the primary botanicals. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Licorice Root (Glycyrrhizin Acid) </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In traditional medicine licorice root has been used to relieve and treat ulcers, sore throats, bronchitis, coughs, adrenal insufficiencies and allergic diseases. Licorice's main antiviral compounds are known as glycyrrhizins (GL). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Japan's National Institute of Infectious Disease reported GL's effectiveness against coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus. After the deadly SARS outbreak in 2012, virologists at Frankfurt University Medical School </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/news030609-16\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">investigated several antiviral compounds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> to treat patients admitted with SARS coronavirus infections. Of all the compounds tested, licorice's GL was the most effective. The scientists concluded that \"Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.\"  The above research was later replicated at Sun Yat Sen University in China and published in the Chinese journal </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Bing Du Xue Bao</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. The researchers identified several derivatives of glycyrrhizin as primary molecules with antiviral properties. In addition to being effective against the SARS coronavirus, they also found it may be effective against herpes, HIV, hepatitis and influenza. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15715493\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Earlier in 2005</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a team of scientists from Goethe University in Germany and the Russian Academy of Sciences had already identified the antiviral activity of GL against SARS coronavirus. The molecule showed a ten-fold increase in anti-SARS activity compared to other potential treatments tested. One conjugate of GL had a 70-fold increase. That study was published in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Journal of Medical Chemistry</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885816\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">During that same year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, the Chinese Academy of Sciences screened over 200 botanical plants used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to find those with the strong potency SARS coronavirus. Four botanicals stood out. One of the four was licorice's glycyrrhizin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Elderberry (Sambucus nigra)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Elderberry has become a popular supplement for relieving symptoms of the common cold and flu infections. It is found worldwide and is part of many of the world's indigenous pharmacopias. There are many species of elderberry; the species </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sambucus nigra</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> seemingly has been shown to have the most medicinal qualities. When purchasing Elderberry or Sambucus, it is recommended to note it is Sambucus nigra. It is better to use a prepared formula rather than try to make it on your own from fresh berries and flowers. Elderberries contain cyangenic glycosides that can be poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea and weakness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Most research has focused on elderberry's therapeutic value against influenza. However, there is also research showing elderberry's positive impact on coronavirus infections. In 2014, researchers at Emory University noted that elderberry extract inhibited coronavirus virility at the point of infection.  The scientists hypothesized that elderberry rendered the virus non infectious. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560964\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One of the better studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> came out of National Sun Yat Sen University and the China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan in 2019. The researchers used an ethanol extract of Sambucus stem (not the berry) and observed its potential against coronavirus strain NL63</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Echinacea</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A systematic review of the existing research before 2011 by the University of British Columbia and published in the journal </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pharmaceuticals</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, concluded:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Echinacea purpurea</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> preparation\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Echinicea does present limitations depending upon the severity of an infection. Once a cold caused by any one of the various cold viruses, including coronavirus, more deeply infects the bronchia and the lower lung, echinacea does not appear to be helpful. It is more effective with upper respiratory tract infections. One of the largest placebo double blind studies on echinacea was conducted by Cardifff University in the UK. The study followed participants for four months and confirmed the safety of long term echinacea supplementation. It also observed a statistically significant decrease in cold episodes in the echinacea group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As a piece of consumer advice, a Cornell University study looked at the medicinal properties throughout different parts of the echinicea plant: leaves, stems, bark, roots, etc. The scientists noted that only echinacea extracts that contain the root showed significant antiviral properties. Echinacea appears to modify the clinical course of flu-like respiratory infection by acting upon IL-8, IL-10 and IFN cytokine activity beneficially.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Olive Leaf</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Oleuropein (OLE) is the most important biomolecule in the olive tree that contributes to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral activities and effects. One advantage of olive leaf is that it is highly bioavailable to the body's cells. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There are almost 10,000 studies in the National Institutes of Health literature database referring to OLE, olive leaf, and olive oil, most with respect to its strong antioxidant and anticancer properties. There are only a few studies showing olive leaf's effectiveness against respiratory viruses. One randomized trial performed by the University of Auckland in New Zealand suggests olive leaf can contribute to treating respiratory illnesses, including coronavirus. A </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11724241\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">2001 study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> out of the University of Hong Kong identified 6 separate antiviral agents in olive that were effective against parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">OLE may possess notable anti-viral properties. The current Covid19 pandemic utilizes the host cell's ACE2 receptor. This same receptor is also activated in HIV infections. This is one reason why patients infected with this new coronavirus strain are being prescribed HIV drugs. Therefore might olive leaf extract contribute to the treatment for this new coronavirus strain? </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Oregano Oil</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Oregano possesses a compound called carvacrol that has been shown to be antiviral. Although it has been tested on several influenza and flu-like respiratory viruses, it does not appear to have been tested against coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994788/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Soochow University in China and the University of Oklahoma</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> published a study in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">BMC Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> focusing on oregano's antiviral properties against influenza viruses. Although oregano did not kill the virus it nevertheless inhibited the virus' ability to translate proteins responsible for the viral binding to cells. A </span><a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/690346/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">2010 randomized double blind study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> study published in </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> suggested oregano was beneficial as a throat spray and showed significant and immediate improvement of upper respiratory infectious ailments.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779581\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">University of Arizona</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> published a paper in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Journal of Applied Microbiology</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> investigating oregano's antiviral properties when used as a sanitizer. The study focused on one flu-like virus, novovirus. If sprayed on surfaces, carvacrol will kill the virus within 15 minutes of exposure. The most recent research into Covid19's surface life -- living outside of an animal host -- is 9 days.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Yes, we should be concerned about the coronavirus' high infectious rate. At the moment, the primary solutions being sought to handle the crisis is to spend billions of dollars to develop an effective vaccine and an accurate diagnostic kit. Additionally, according to a study out of Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, the incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days for being infected and capable of infecting others without displaying symptoms. But there is no mention in the medical community nor the mainstream media about what we can do to strengthen our immune system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Yes, a high quality 99% barrier mask is important, especially if worn in a crowded environment. Repeated washing of our hands for a full minute with soap water. Rub surfaces with alcohol at home and work and allow it to sit for 30 seconds. Likewise, wipe down door handles and telephone receivers. Quarantining people who have been exposed is important until they test negative. Closing schools is prudent. And if a vaccine is eventually developed and shown to be safe and effective that is another recourse. However none of the above protects the immune system in the event of coming into contact with the virus. We believe that the recommended natural solutions shared above, since it is supported in the peer reviewed scientific literature, is something everyone can do. Besides, it is safe and not expensive. Therefore these natural solutions too should be considered as a viable and effective recourse to lessen this pandemic's fatal effects. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Additional Tips</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Although supplementing our diets and strengthening our immune systems at this time is especially important, we must not neglect our physical health and mind. Beside having the opportunity to transition to a healthy plant based diet, increasing our exercise is crucial and taking time to meditate. To return to maximal health, exercise for a minimum of 2 and half hours per week, and meditate 30 minutes daily to de-stress. It can also be an opportunity to experiment with intermittent fasts, such as not eating for a 12 hour span between dinner and breakfast. All of these suggestions are supported in the peer-reviewed medical literature. This is not folk medicine or social gossip. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Final Thought</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One immediate hard lesson we are learning is that the US government has no noteworthy competence in dealing with national health crises. We are only good at pouring money into the personal coffers of elites who are content to capitalize on disasters. If the tiny virus is David, certainly the cumbersomeness and America's huge bureaucracy is Goliath. If progressive voices are unable to leverage themselves to change the face our civilization for a potentially sustainable future, maybe the tiny COVID-19 will be doing it for us. </span></p>",

            "description": "<h1>Antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke may delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia</h1>\n<p><strong>Clinical Muncipal Hospital (Romania), March 17, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Currently we are facing a dementia epidemic, with estimations showing that by 2050 approximately 131 million people will be affected. Every 7 seconds a patient is diagnosed worldwide. Because the common forms of dementia occur in the elderly, delaying the onset or worsening of the cognitive impairment could translate into a significant reduction of the incidence of the disease. Estimations have shown that of the huge number of cases expected by 2050, roughly 23 million could be avoided if the onset of the disease could be delayed by 2 years. Despite the ambition to identify a disease modifying therapy or a cure for dementia by 2025 set by the G8 dementia summit in 2013, the findings so far are not very encouraging.</p>\n<p>To date there is growing evidence of the association of vascular risk factors like hypertension, high cholesterol levels or diabetes mellitus with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, simply managing these risk factors had little effect in reducing the incidence of dementia. These factors, however, strongly increase the risk of a patient to suffer an ischemic stroke and incident stroke approximately doubles the risk of dementia. From the study of Saver published in 2006 we know that \"each hour in which treatment fails to occur the brain loses as many neurons as it does in 3.6 years of normal aging\".</p>\n<p>These neuronal losses occur through ischemic necrosis in the core of the infarction, but may be prolonged up to 2 weeks after the ischemic insult in the penumbral area surrounding the ischemic core through another type of cell loss, namely apoptosis. In initiating apoptosis oxidative species have a major role. Several authors have shown consistent increases in oxidative stress after an ischemic stroke. As the authors pointed out in a previous study, oxidative stress increases mainly after cardioembolic stroke, followed by lacunar stroke, with a less prolonged burst of generation of oxidative species following thrombotic stroke.</p>\n<p>There is a considerable overlap between the oxidative stress-induced pathogenesis in ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease including mitochondrial dysfunction (the mitochondria being the main generators of energy in the cells), calcium overload of the cells, activation of different destructive enzymes by the excess intracellular calcium, aberrant gene transcription and expression, induction of autophagy (a process by which cells degrade their own cytoplasmic proteins and organelles) and activation of inflammatory responses.</p>\n<p>Despite promising results of antioxidant molecules in animal models of ischemic stroke, human clinical trials were disappointing possibly due to late administration and incorrect selection of patients. However, in a study published in 2019, edaravone (an antioxidant molecule) given within 48 hours after endovascular revascularization in acute ischemic stroke was associated with greater functional independence at hospital discharge, lower in-hospital mortality and reduced intracranial hemorrhage after admission in a study which enrolled over 10,000 patients. More recently in a report presented at the International Stroke Conference 2020, nerinetide or NA1, a molecule which reduces endogenous nitric oxide (also an oxidative species) generated inside the cell during ischemia, improved the outcome of ischemic stroke patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy. Unfortunately, NA1 interacted with alteplase, limiting its efficiency in patients who were also thrombolysed.</p>\n<p>Antioxidants have been evaluated also in patients suffering from degenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease included, with promising results in animal models but inconclusive results in clinical trials. Therapeutic strategies are hampered by the dual role of oxidative species in the organism. On one hand, increased ROS production contributes to age-related chronic conditions and on the other, oxidant species function as signaling molecules in pathways that are critical for cell survival. However, based on the compelling evidence of the implication of oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis and of the pivotal role of mitochondria, molecules acting as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants show promise in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, improve mitochondrial function after coronary ischemia/reperfusion in rats, and some have already been developed into drugs used in clinical trials in type 2 diabetic patients.</p>\n<p>In view of the implication of oxidative stress in the genesis of AD pathology, the authors hypothesize that with aging, in the presence of well-established vascular risk factors, and possibly with a genetic contribution, AD pathology develops slowly without clinically overt cognitive impairment. However, after a stroke there is a sudden burst in oxidative stress which accelerates the pathogenesis of dementia and leads to clinically obvious cognitive impairment. If this hypothesis would be proven the reason for reaching antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke would be reinforced. Further studies in this direction with long follow-up periods would be needed. Nonetheless, in view of the high incidence and prevalence of the disease, the results could be rewarding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Spinach supplements can enhance athletic performance</h1>\n<p><strong>Freie University (Germany), March 17, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Supplements that contain an anabolic compound from spinach should be in the list of prohibited substances in sports, according to a recent study. Researchers from Australia, Germany and Italy looked at the effects of ecdysterone, a naturally occurring plant steroid, in young men undergoing strength training and found that it can <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325661\">boost physical performance and increase muscle mass</a>. This compound has been dubbed the “Russian secret” in the 1980s due to heavy suspicions that Russian athletes were using it as a performance-boosting supplement.</p>\n<h2>How anabolic agents work</h2>\n<p>Substances that fall under the category of anabolic steroidal agents or <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/anabolic-steroids\">anabolic-androgenic steroids</a> are either synthetic or naturally occurring variations of the male sex hormone, testosterone. Often referred to as simply steroids, these drugs are designed to treat hormonal issues, such as delayed puberty. <a href=\"https://naturalpedia.com/steroid-resistant-nephrotic-syndrome-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html\">Steroids</a> are also used to address muscle loss brought about by serious conditions like <a href=\"https://naturalpedia.com/aids-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html\">AIDS</a> or cancer.</p>\n<p>However, steroids rose to notoriety when athletes and weight lifters began misusing them. The anabolic and androgenic properties of steroids allow them to promote not only male sex characteristics, but also anabolism, a bodily process that <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8871\">allows the growth of new cells</a>. These activities result in enhanced athletic performance and increased muscle growth and strength.</p>\n<p>Ecdysterone is the main compound in spinach extract and is classified as a phytosteroid. In plants, phytosteroids serve as <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-3078-5_11\">structural components of cell membranes</a>, as insect deterrents and as growth hormones. Many plant steroids, such as those derived from <a href=\"https://naturalpedia.com/boswellia-sources-health-benefits-nutrients-uses-and-constituents-at-naturalpedia-com.html\">boswellia</a>, fenugreek and licorice, are valued in traditional medicine for their <a href=\"http://www.phytopharmajournal.com/Vol4_Issue2_12.pdf\">anti-inflammatory activities</a> and are used to treat conditions like lung diseases, allergic asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p>According to previous studies in animals, ecdysterone from <a href=\"https://naturalpedia.com/spinach-sources-health-benefits-nutrients-uses-and-constituents-at-naturalpedia-com.html\">spinach</a> has many beneficial effects, most notably increasing the synthesis of protein in skeletal muscles. The compound has also proven itself to be more potent than anabolic agents currently banned in sports, such as the synthetic steroid metandienone. (Related: <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/035591_spinach_nutrients_steroids.html\">Pump up your body with the Popeye vegetable – spinach</a>.)</p>\n<h2>Ecdysterone from spinach can boost athletic performance</h2>\n<p>Recent studies suggest that the anabolic effect of ecdysterone is influenced by its binding to estrogen receptors. But while multiple studies have investigated the effects of this plant steroid, those that involved humans are very rarely accessible. </p>\n<p>For their study, which appeared in the journal <em>Archives of Toxicology</em>, the researchers recruited 46 young men to participate in an intervention study of strength training that lasted for 10 weeks. They gave the participants <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00204-019-02490-x\">ecdysterone-contaning supplements</a> and evaluated their effect on physical performance.</p>\n<p>The researchers analyzed blood and urine samples for ecdysterone and biomarkers of performance enhancement, and screened for prohibited performance-enhancing substances to ensure the specificity of the measured effects. They also tested the supplements for anabolic steroid contamination before giving them to the participants.</p>\n<p>The researchers reported that those who received ecdysterone showed significantly higher increases in muscle mass. They also observed the same increase in the number and growth of muscle cells (hypertrophy) in cell culture experiments. </p>\n<p>With respect to athletic performance, the researchers found that ecdysterone enabled the participants to perform more one-repetition bench presses without increasing biomarkers for liver or kidney toxicity. </p>\n<p>Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that <a href=\"http://phytonutrients.news/\">ecdysterone from spinach</a> can greatly enhance athletic performance, so its use as a supplement should be prohibited in sports. They propose that ecdysterone be classified under “other anabolic agents,” the use of which is banned in any competition. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Adding turmeric to green tea enhances its health benefits, study finds</h1>\n<p><strong>Rajarshi Shahu College of Pharmacy (India), March 17, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Today, numerous studies on the beneficial properties of green tea credit it with possessing a variety of antioxidant compounds. Among these compounds, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant and extensively studied. EGCG is said to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/egcg-epigallocatechin-gallate\">reduce inflammation</a>, aid in weight loss and even support heart health by lowering blood cholesterol levels. However, the effectiveness of EGCG is hindered by its poor bioavailability.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to increase its absorption in the intestines, researchers from <a href=\"https://www.shahucollegelatur.org.in/\"><em>Rajarshi Shahu College of Pharmacy and Research</em></a> in India decided to combine it with another potent plant compound. Like EGCG, curcumin from turmeric has plenty of beneficial properties but poor bioavailability. Despite this, the researchers found that <a href=\"https://science.news/2020-02-24-curcumin-enhances-bioavailability-of-green-tea-flavonoids.html\">curcumin can enhance the absorption of EGCG</a> by increasing intestinal permeability. They discussed this finding in detail in an article published in <em>BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine</em>.</p>\n<h2>EGCG and curcumin: a potent combo against hypercholesterolemia</h2>\n<p>According to previous studies, EGCG from green tea is <a href=\"https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2545-1\">effective against high blood cholesterol</a> or hypercholesterolemia. However, its low bioavailability decreases its potential, especially in promoting heart health.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, the researchers first extracted EGCG from <a href=\"https://naturalpedia.com/green-tea-sources-health-benefits-nutrients-uses-and-constituents-at-naturalpedia-com.html\">green tea</a> leaves and confirmed its presence using chromatography. They then confirmed the compatibility of the green tea extract (GTE) with curcumin.</p>\n<p>Using everted goat intestine, the researchers tested the effect of GTE alone or in combination with <a href=\"https://naturalpedia.com/curcumin-sources-health-benefits-and-uses.html\">curcumin</a> on intestinal permeability. They reported that the GTE-curcumin mixture showed higher permeation than GTE alone.</p>\n<p>When they treated rats fed a high-fat diet with GTE or the GTE-curcumin mixture, the researchers found that the mixture exerted a significant lipid-regulating effect. At the end of the treatment, the rats that received the mixture had lower cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL and VLDL levels than the rats given GTE alone.</p>\n<p>Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that curcumin can enhance intestinal permeability and consequently the absorption of EGCG. Hence, EGCG-curcumin formulations can be a <a href=\"http://nutraceuticals.news/\">promising nutraceutical</a> for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Vitamin D boosts chances of walking after hip fracture</h1>\n<p><strong>Rutgers University, March 16, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senior citizens who are not vitamin D deficient have a better chance of walking after hip fracture surgery, according to a Rutgers-led study.</p>\n<p>The findings in <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> suggest that vitamin D deficiency could limit mobility in older adults, said senior author <a href=\"https://nutrition.rutgers.edu/faculty/sue-shapses.html\">Sue Shapses</a>, a professor in the <a href=\"https://nutrition.rutgers.edu/\">Department of Nutritional Sciences</a> at the <a href=\"https://sebs.rutgers.edu/\">School of Environmental and Biological Sciences</a> at <a href=\"https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/\">Rutgers University-New Brunswick</a>.</p>\n<p>Shapses suggests that older adults take 800 international units (IU), equivalent to 20 micrograms, of vitamin D daily to prevent deficiency. Vitamin D is important for bone health, and people get it through some foods, exposure to the sun and vitamin pills.</p>\n<p>\"An important next step is learning how vitamin D affects mobility,\" said Shapses, who is also an adjunct professor in the Department of Medicine at <a href=\"http://rwjms.rutgers.edu/\">Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School</a> and director of the <a href=\"https://ifnh.rutgers.edu/centers/nutrition-exercise-metabolism/\">Center for Human Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism</a> at Rutgers' <a href=\"https://ifnh.rutgers.edu/\">New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition, and Health</a>. \"For example, it is not clear if severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with direct effects on muscle, cognition and/or other organ systems.\"</p>\n<p>A broken hip - among the most serious fall injuries - is hard to recover from, with many people unable to live on their own afterward. In the United States, more than 300,000 people 65 or older are hospitalized for hip fractures annually and falling causes more than 95 percent of these type of fractures. Women fall more frequently than men, experiencing three-quarters of hip fractures, and the number of fractures is likely to rise as the population ages, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adulthipfx.html\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>\n<p>Regaining mobility after a hip fracture is important for full recovery and to reduce the risk of death. But vitamin D deficiency is associated with reduced mobility after surgery to repair a hip fracture.</p>\n<p>The multi-site study of patients 65 or older in the United States and Canada examined the influence of vitamin D levels in blood serum and nutrition on mobility. The study focused on death rate or inability to walk 10 feet (or across a room) without someone's help after surgery.</p>\n<p>The findings showed that vitamin D levels greater than 12 nanograms per milliliter (12 parts per billion) in blood serum are associated with a higher rate of walking at 30 and 60 days after hip fracture surgery. While poor nutrition is associated with reduced mobility 30 days after surgery, that factor was not statistically significant. Still, in patients with high levels of parathyroid hormone, which leads to high levels of calcium in blood, mobility was reduced if their nutritional status was poor.</p>\n<p>\"This matters because vitamin D deficiency and malnutrition are common disorders in elderly patients with hip fractures and often occur together since both are complications of poor nutrition,\" Shapses said.</p>\n<p>Previous studies have shown that taking 800 IU of vitamin D a day can prevent falling and fractures. A <a href=\"https://www.rutgers.edu/news/more-vitamin-d-may-improve-memory-too-much-may-slow-reaction-time\">Rutgers-led study published last year</a> indicated that high vitamin D intake (4,000 IU a day) compared with 600 IU a day may reduce reaction time, potentially boosting the risk of falling and fractures. The <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitamin%20D-HealthProfessional/\">recommended dietary allowance</a> for vitamin D is 600 IU daily for people from 1 to 70 years old and 800 for people over 70.</p>\n<p>\"These studies suggest that too much or too little vitamin D will affect mobility and falls in the elderly,\" Shapses said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Inflammation in the brain linked to several forms of dementia</h1>\n<p><strong>University of Cambridge, March 16, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inflammation in the brain may be more widely implicated in dementias than was previously thought, suggests new research from the University of Cambridge. The researchers say it offers hope for potential new treatments for several types of dementia.</p>\n<p>Inflammation is usually the body's response to injury and stress - such as the redness and swelling that accompanies an injury or infection. However, inflammation in the brain - known as neuroinflammation - has been recognised and linked to many disorders including depression, psychosis and multiple sclerosis. It has also recently been linked to the risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<p>In a study published today in the journal <em>Brain</em>, a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge set out to examine whether neuroinflammation also occurs in other forms of dementia, which would imply that it is common to many neurodegenerative diseases.</p>\n<p>The team recruited 31 patients with three different types of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is a family of different conditions resulting from the build-up of several abnormal 'junk' proteins in the brain.</p>\n<p>Patients underwent brain scans to detect inflammation and the junk proteins. Two Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans each used an injection with a chemical 'dye', which lights up special molecules that reveal either the brain's inflammatory cells or the junk proteins.</p>\n<p>In the first scan, the dye lit up the cells causing neuroinflammation. These indicate ongoing damage to the brain cells and their connections. In the second scan, the dye binds to the different types of 'junk' proteins found in FTD.</p>\n<p>The researchers showed that across the brain, and in all three types of FTD, the more inflammation in each part of the brain, the more harmful build-up of the junk proteins there is. To prove the dyes were picking up the inflammation and harmful proteins, they went on to analyse under the microscope 12 brains donated after death to the Cambridge Brain Bank.</p>\n<p>\"We predicted the link between inflammation in the brain and the build-up of damaging proteins, but even we were surprised by how tightly these two problems mapped on to each other,\" said Dr Thomas Cope from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Cambridge.</p>\n<p>Dr Richard Bevan Jones added, \"There may be a vicious circle where cell damage triggers inflammation, which in turn leads to further cell damage.\"</p>\n<p>The team stress that further research is needed to translate this knowledge of inflammation in dementia into testable treatments. But, this new study shows that neuroinflammation is a significant factor in more types of dementia than was previously thought.</p>\n<p>\"It is an important discovery that all three types of frontotemporal dementia have inflammation, linked to the build-up of harmful abnormal proteins in different parts of the brain. The illnesses are in other ways very different from each other, but we have found a role for inflammation in all of them,\" says Professor James Rowe from the Cambridge Centre for Frontotemporal Dementia.</p>\n<p>\"This, together with the fact that it is known to play a role in Alzheimer's, suggests that inflammation is part of many other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. This offers hope that immune-based treatments might help slow or prevent these conditions.\"</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong> </strong></p>\n<h1>Intestinal flora dysbiosis aggravates cognitive dysfunction associated with neuroinflammation in heart failure</h1>\n<p><strong>Harbin Medical University (China), March 15, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to news reporting from Harbin, People’s Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, “Cognitive dysfunction after heart failure (HF) is characterized by neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cognitive dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that an intestinal flora imbalance may also trigger neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.”</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, “The present study was designed to reveal that intestinal flora dysbiosis caused by HF aggravates neuroinflammation-associated cognitive impairment. Adult male SD rats were fed daily for 2 weeks with probiotics or placebo until the day of surgery. HF was then triggered by 8 weeks of sustained coronary artery occlusion. 16S rDNA sequencing was used to confirm intestinal flora dysbiosis after HF and demonstrate that the changes paralleled intestinal pathology scores. The permeability of the blood-brain barrier was increased after HF, and such an increase in permeability may increase the levels of inflammatory cytokines caused by intestinal flora disorders. The changes in the intestinal flora caused by probiotics significantly reduced the level of neuroinflammation. In addition, probiotic administration considerably improved the impaired spatial memory in HF rats.”</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “We conclude that intestinal flora dysbiosis plays a potential role in aggravating the impaired cognition associated with neuroinflammation and that these effects may be attenuated by probiotics.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Cellular stress makes obese mothers have obese babies</h1>\n<p><strong>French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, March 16, 2020</strong></p>\n<p>Maternal obesity increases the risk for obesity and metabolic perturbations in their offspring, but what are the mechanisms? In a new study published March 12 in the open-access journal <em>PLOS Biology</em>, Sebastien Bouret of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Lille, France, and colleagues show that a key step in the process is the triggering of stress in a complex membrane system within all cells called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). That stress leads to critical changes in the development of the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls hunger, satiety, and metabolic rate.</p>\n<p>The ER constitutes the largest network of membranes within a cell, and plays a central role in the synthesis of proteins and many other biological processes. In response to <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cellular+stress/\">cellular stress</a>, the ER activates the so-called \"unfolded protein response,\" whose normal function is to restore the cellular balance, but whose prolonged activation has been linked to obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in adults. Because of this link, and because maternal obesity has also been linked to abnormal development of the hypothalamus, the authors asked whether ER stress might be tied directly to obesity-driven hypothalamic changes.</p>\n<p>Working in mice, they began by showing that maternal obesity led to increased <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+weight/\">body weight</a> in <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/male+offspring/\">male offspring</a>, with an increase in food intake, reduced oxygen consumption, and impaired glucose tolerance (female offspring were not affected, for reasons that remain to be explored). These changes were accompanied by ER stress in several tissues, including the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, a key site for metabolic regulation. One known mechanism for that regulation is through signaling by the hormone leptin; leptin inhibits hunger, and maternal obesity is known to increase resistance to its effects.</p>\n<p>The authors showed that all these changes could be mitigated by treating offspring with the naturally occurring <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bile+acid/\">bile acid</a> tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which is known to promote refolding of proteins and alleviate ER stress. When the mice pups of obese mothers received TUDCA, neuronal development within their arcuate nucleus was normalized, leptin signaling was restored, and the alterations in body weight, glucose tolerance, and most other physiologic measures were reversed.</p>\n<p>\"Obesity is a complex phenomenon that likely has multiple drivers but the relative importance of <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/maternal+obesity/\">maternal obesity</a>-induced ER stress in promoting offspring obesity was not known,\" Bouret said. \"The results from this study suggest it does play an important role by disrupting the development of brain pathways that control appetite\" he adds. \"Interestingly, TUDCA has been approved in the United States and Europe to treat specific liver and neurodegenerative disorders, raising the possibility that the clinical use of this ER stress-relieving drug could be expanded to treatment of childhood obesity, which now affects more than 40 million children worldwide.\"</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </p>\n<p><strong>Dietary anti-cancer compound may work by influence on cellular genetics</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Oregon State University, March 15, 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Researchers have discovered one of the reasons why broccoli may be good for your health.</p>\n<p>They found that sulforaphane, a dietary compound from broccoli that's known to help prevent prostate cancer, may work through its influence on long, non-coding RNAs. This is another step forward in a compelling new area of study on the underlying genetics of cancer development and progression.</p>\n<p>The findings were published by researchers from Oregon State University in the <em>Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The research provides more evidence for how these lncRNAs, which were once thought to be a type of \"junk DNA\" of no particular value or function, may instead play a critical role in triggering cells to become malignant and spread.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Growing evidence shows that lncRNAs, which number in the thousands, have a major role in cell biology and development, often by controlling what genes are turned on, or \"expressed\" to carry out their genetic function. Scientists now believe that when these lncRNAs are dysregulated they can contribute to multiple disease processes, including cancer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unlike many chemotherapeutic drugs that affect healthy cells as well as malignant ones and can cause undesired side effects, the control of lncRNAs may offer a new way to specifically prevent or slow the progression of malignant cells.</p>\n<p>\"This could be a turning point in our understanding of how cancer may be triggered and spreads,\" said Emily Ho, the endowed director of the Moore Family Center for Whole Grain Foods, Nutrition and Preventive Health at OSU, a professor in the College of Public Health and Human Sciences and principal investigator with the Linus Pauling Institute.</p>\n<p>\"It's obviously of interest that this dietary compound, found at some of its highest levels in broccoli, can affect lncRNAs. This could open the door to a whole range of new dietary strategies, foods or drugs that might play a role in cancer suppression or therapeutic control.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In particular, this research showed that one lncRNA, called LINC01116, is upregulated in a human cell line of prostate cancer, but can be decreased by treatment with sulforaphane. The data \"reinforce the idea that lncRNAs are an exciting new avenue for chemoprevention research, and chemicals derived from diet can alter their expression,\" the scientists wrote in their study.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"We showed that treatment with sulforaphane could normalize the levels of this lncRNA,\" said Laura Beaver, a research associate in the Linus Pauling Institute and College of Public Health and Human Sciences, and lead author on the study. \"This may relate to more than just cancer prevention. It would be of significant value if we could develop methods to greatly slow the progress of cancer, help keep it from becoming invasive.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The impact of diet on lncRNA expression has been largely unknown until now, the researchers said. In this study, they identified a four-fold decrease in the ability of prostate cancer cells to form colonies when LINC01116 was disrupted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Among men, prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer globally, and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Worth noting, the researchers said, is that an increased consumption of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, which are high in sulforaphane, appears to be associated with a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That same lncRNA, they noted, is also overexpressed in studies of several other types of cancer, including brain, lung and colon cancer.

            "description": "<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>5G: The End of All Things</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Progressive Radio Network, March 16, 2020</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have become thoroughly accustomed and habituated to endless advertising by drug makers to buy into the promises of pharmaceutical drugs or to consent to the nutritional value of junk food.  Yet the drug and food industries are completely indifferent to their products' dangerous adverse effects. They give no thought to what it does to our health. All that matters is the business' bottom line.  Fortunately, we have the freedom to make informed choices about most areas that impact our lives, whether it be living a healthy lifestyle or eating nutritious foods. But that is about to  change completely due to the brilliant marketing campaigns to make life easier with the arrival of 5G's Internet of Things into our homes, bedrooms, offices and streets and avenues. What we are not being told is that as 5G technology increases, we will eventually be living in a 24 hour cycle that carries threats that are potentially far more dangerous than the occasional hamburger, pizza or beer.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nobody seems to be asking whether the introduction of 5G will truly improve the quality of our lives.  Is there any redeeming truth to telecom's promises?  There are none. But unlike a drug or unhealthy habits that can cause death, the FCC under the Clinton presidency passed legislation through Congress that hands over carte blanch permission to the telecommunications industry to directly violate our democratic freedoms of choice. Privacy will disappear altogether since this new technology increases surveillance capabilities exponentially.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">And the average citizen has no choice. You cannot prevent Verizon or any of the other telecom giants from installing 5G transmission antennae in your neighborhoods, grade schools and playgrounds, apartment complexes, hospitals, and parks. And this enormous technological feat will also require a minimum of 50,000 new satellites orbiting the heavens above our heads to beam transmission signals to every habitable place on the planet. This new network will be five times greater than the number of operative satellites in space already.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">The precautionary principle is intended to avoid inflicting unnecessary harm and injury in order to reduce avoidable health risks, and more importantly death.  But this principle is being completely ignored with the full frontal assault to implement 5G at maximum speed. During a Congressional hearing, Senator Richard Blumenthal asked a very poignant question. Do you have any science confirming that 5G is safe? Is money being spent on studies to determine electromagnetic frequency radiation's safety. At the hearing, every representative of the telecom industry said there were none that they were aware of.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Imagine for a minute that the FDA were to approve and register a drug or vaccine that had never been tested for safety on humans?  That would never be permissible; however the telecom industry is doing just that. And their primary market is the millennial and iGen generations who are also most susceptible to EMF's adverse effects. These are the generations who grew up with social media and chat rooms and who virtually live through the internet. It is their panacea that is fully integrated into their purpose and meaning in life.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">This dark and deadly side of EMF emitting technology, especially 5G, is being hidden by our multimedia system that is being paid to manufacture both consent and doubt: consent that 5G will somehow miraculously improve our lives, and doubt against the 10,000-plus studies that show 5G will be one of the greatest health and environmental risks humanity has ever faced.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">This month, <em>IEEE Access</em> published a special study out of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India as part of its <em>Special Section on Antenna and Propagation for 5G</em>. The article, \"Electromagnetic Radiation Due to Cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Technologies: How Safe are We?,\" is an excellent summary of the state of the science regarding 5G's future threats based upon the confirming evidence at present.  To date there are already 15 billion wireless local area network routers connected with the Internet of Things and 9 billion mobile connections.  Almost 70% of the world's current population is using mobile phones.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thousands of studies have been collected that indicate EMF's health risks. <a href=\"https://bioinitiative.org/\">The BioInitiative Report</a> has compiled 1800 studies alone showing serious impact on both humans' and animals' gene transcriptions, genotoxicity, DNA damage, chromatin condensation, loss of DNA repair capacity, reduction of free-radical scavengers, neurotoxicity, decreased sperm morphology, and impaired development of brain and cranial bone.  Worse, Igor Belyaev's <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275967247_Complex_exposure_to_eleCtromagnetiC_Fields_Electromagnetic_Field_Effects_on_Cells_and_Cancer_Risks_from_Mobile_Communication\">research at the Slovak Academy of Sciences</a> has found evidence that some frequencies emitted by this technology damages all cells, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes and stem cells. The Indian scientists <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9016183\">breakdown EMF's health risks</a> into seven main headings.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Back in 2011, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer <a href=\"https://www.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr208_E.pdf\">classified</a> radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans. Nine years later, this threat has been confirmed by thousands of medical professionals. No longer are the risks simply possibilities. It is a reality. The US' National Toxicology Program's <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/releases/2018/november1/index.cfm\">final report</a> on mouse and rat studies in late 2018 confirmed cancerous heart tumors due to the earlier 2G and 3G cell phone technologies. One of the world's leading experts in wireless technology's cancer risks, oncologist Leonard Hardell at the University Hospital in Orebro, Sweden, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6254861/\">concludes that</a> \"the evidence that RF radiation exposure is a risk factor for cancer is particularly worrying, taking the present deployment of the fifth generation (5G) for wireless communication.\" Dr. Hardell, along with hundreds of other scientists and medical doctors have demanded a moratorium against 5G until further independent studies are performed to assure the industry's denials of its hazards can be confirmed.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asp/jmihi/2018/00000008/00000006/art00023\">study published</a> in the August 2018 issue of <em>Journal of Medical Imaging and Health Informatics, </em>after an extensive review and analysis of the medical literature researchers concluded that \"incidence of cancer cases was remarkably higher among people who resided in 400 meters from mobile antennas, in comparison to those who lived further away. Inhabitants living close to cellular antennas are also at increased risk for developing neuropsychiatric complaints.\" Under the 5G regimen every American in a suburb or city will be living 100 meters or less from a 5G antenna. In 2016, the Europa EM-EMF <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/scientists-and-doctors-warn-of-potential-serious-health-impacts-of-fifth-generation-5g-wireless-technology/5609503\">guideline found</a> \"strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, and male infertility…Common EHS (electromagnetic hypersensitivity) symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Populations living within 350 meters of a 850 MHz, 1500 watt cell phone tower in Netanya, Israel experienced a 400 percent cancer increase (i.e., carcinoma of the breast, ovary, lung, kidney, bone, and Hodgkin’s disease)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Pregnancy and Infertility</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">The <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9016183\">science is conclusive</a> that EMF's erratic pulses from mobile phones induces oxidative stress that damage testicular tissues and decreases sperm quality and motility. EMF exposure results in sperm mutations that have been <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0952-4746/30/3/R01/meta\">shown by scientists</a> at the University of Mainz in Germany to contribute to testicular cancer. Prof John Aitken at the University of Newcastle has shown that sperm exposed to mobile phone radiation revealed a 300 percent increase in mitochondrial damage.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">We need to take the precautionary principle at heart when animals studies confirm the serious health risks. We are irresponsible when we draw a distinction between alarming animal studies that have yet to be adequately tested in humans and then make assumptions there can be no correlation. Therefore, when <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2305050015000536\">research shows</a> that pregnant animals are exposed to even low levels of EMF will show uterine congestions, dead and reabsorbed fetuses, hemorrhage, unequal and asymetrical distribution of fetus implantation, and genetic malformation, we must consider its risks against pregnant women as well. But the FCC and FDA have been horribly negligent in this regard to warn women.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Auditory System Damage</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">When our phones are linked to the wireless network, our entire auditory system -- skin, inner and middle ear, cochlear nerve and our brain's frontal lobe -- are absorbing EMF radiation. EMFs are damaging the highly sensitive hair-like cells in the cochlear and likely contributing to the neurological disorder known as tinnitus. Tinnitus is becoming increasingly more common. The high pitch sounds associated with this illness disturb normal sleep patterns and in more serious cases interfere with normal cognitive abilities and has even led to suicides, according to a <a href=\"https://oem.bmj.com/content/67/12/804\">study conducted</a> by the Medical University of Vienna and published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>. Additional studies have associated long term mobile use with hearing loss.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Adverse Childhood Development</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition to EMF's adverse effects on the developing fetus, the younger generations are the most exposed population to EMF radiation through excessive wireless device use. It is well known that children's brain tissue displays much more electrical conductivity when compared to an adult. A child's brain also absorbs EMF radiation more readily. The geometry of a child’s head significantly increases mobile phone EMF absorption in the brain, eye, cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. According to a study published in the journal <em>Physics in Medicine and Biology</em>, children have especially high bone marrow conductivity, greatly increasing EMF absorption.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Consequently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AeSoC6la9c\">a study</a> out of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute looking at 7th through 9th graders found that cumulative phone use decreased memory.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Blood-Related Disorders</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Even very low intensity EMF frequencies -- much lower than what 5G will expose us to -- interrupt the blood brain barrier that hinders toxic chemicals from disrupting various tissues, including the brain. EMFs interfere with this protective barrier. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8012056\">Dr. G Salford</a> at Lund University in Sweden, observed that a single two hour cellular phone session will produce leakage in this barrier and after 50 day use can lead to neuronal damage.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>DNA Damage</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Medical scientists are quick to warn about the mechanisms by which our cellular DNA interact with EMF radiation. In fact, the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9016183\">DNA's double helix structure</a> \"causes it to act like a fractal antenna\" whereby it interacts with a wide range of different electromagnetic frequencies. For this reason DNA is highly susceptible to damage across the wide spectrum of wireless frequency ranges. The DNA-EMF interaction creates free radicals that contribute to stress proteins and ultimately gene mutations, including in stem cells.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Mental and Cognitive Risks</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">The <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9016183\">scientific literature</a> increasingly reveals that EMF exposure is contributing to the growing rates in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. EMF's effects on brain tissue and neurons is an established fact based on epidemiological studies of populations living close to cell towers. 5G will bring these towers into everyone's neighborhoods. An article in <em>Reviews of Environmental Health</em> introduces a new observed disorder -- \"Chronic multi-system illness” (CMSI).  CMSI correlates to milder electromagnetic hypersensitivity to 3 MHz-300 GHz, with headaches, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms. However, beside these milder effects, long term exposure to these high output towers are also contributing to severe brain and cognitive disabilities, including paralysis, stroke and psychosis.  </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">In our opinion, the 5G rollout is an irresponsible experiment with potential holocaust-like consequences in the long term. Neither the US nor China have ever felt obliged to follow UNESCO's Precautionary Principle to avoid \"morally unacceptable harm\" when the science is plausible but still uncertain. In the case of 5G, the harm to human life is conclusive, and <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/scientists-and-doctors-warn-of-potential-serious-health-impacts-of-fifth-generation-5g-wireless-technology/5609503\">in the view</a> of Dr. Lennart Hardell, it may be in violation of the Nuremberg Code.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition there is something largely missing from the 5G debate in the US, whereas some European nations are paying attention to it; that is, existing safety standards for wireless technology are obsolete. This conclusion was arrived at independently by Vienna Medical University in Austria and Carl Blackman at the University of North Carolina, published in the journal <em>Pathophysiology</em>. The problem herein lies in the failures of federal regulatory agencies to be truthful to the scientific evidence rather than show favoritism to the wireless industry's own junk science and commercial interests. Again, private interests profit and the public is harmed.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Unfortunately, the FCC standards for mobile phones have remained the same since 1996. Since 1997, secondary insurance providers have refused to cover health damages due to wireless radiation. During the past two and a half decades, the technology has changed dramatically, and not for the better. This is not simply the words of independent 5G critics in the medical profession announcing health warnings. The FDA also acknowledges the problem. On its website, we find \"the FDA does not review the safety of radiation-emitting consumer products such as cell phones and similar wireless devices before they can be so, as it does with new drugs or medical devices.... However, the FDA does have the authority to take action if cell phones are shown to emit radiofrequency energy at a level that is hazardous to the use.\" Unfortunately, the FDA has never taken charge of this mandate and injunction it has been assigned with.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwyDCHf5iCY&t=1339s\">Dr. Devra Davis</a> is the founder of the Environmental Health Trust and a Visiting Professor of Medicine at the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School and a Visiting Professor of Medicine at Ondokuz Mayis University, Turkey. For years Dr Davis has served as the director of the Center for Environmental Oncology, which she founded, at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute —­ the first institute of its kind in the world to examine the environmental factors that contribute to the majority of cases of cancer.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">During a recent lecture for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AeSoC6la9c\">2020 Expert Forum</a> on 5G and emerging EMF technologis, Dr. Davis outlined many of the gold standard studies that should have us worry about the future ahead as the telecom industry with the blessing of governments roll out 5G. It is not simply EMF exposure from phones and wireless routers that pose dire risks. It is also the accumulative EMF radiation people are exposed to daily -- from laptops, cellular phones, towers and antennas, wi-fi routers, and microwave ovens,</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition to the above risks, Dr. Davis has observed other worrisome EMF effects. Dementia for example has become an epidemic and even young adults as young 30 are starting to show signs of this neurodegenerative condition. Recently dementia has been called \"diabetes of the brain.\" Davis has noted that due to EMF exposure brain scans reveal an increase in glucose levels in brain tissue and increases lipid peroxidation that results in cell damage. Mobile phones also significantly reduce glutathione, an essential enzyme necessary for DNA repair.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">As we reported in the past, the mainstream media, in particular the <em>New York Times</em>, which has a collaborative agreement with the leading 5G provider Verizon, have no intention to warn the public about any of the scientific findings mentioned above. There is a growing consensus in the scientific and medical community that 5G will usher an epidemic of disease never before witnessed in human history. It is too difficult to make forecasts. Nevertheless, if the past and current research on EMF's adverse effects on health and the environment during the past 50 years are any indication, we are entering a new epoch of disease and neurological disorders that humanity is completely unprepared to handle.</p>",

As panic increases and more cases are reported daily, health-minded people are eager or even desperate to know whether there are ways to strengthen the body’s immune system to offer some protection from this specific upper respiratory infection.</p>\n<p>There are six known strains of coronavirus, four which are associated with the common cold or moderate respiratory infections. Everyone has likely had a coronavirus infection at some time in their lives. However, two strains — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) — are much more severe. Between the years 2002-2004 and 2014-2018 these strains respectively were observed to be lethal. However, during this periods, total deaths were less than one thousand. SARS has the ability to infect the lower respiratory system as well. The current strain being called Cov19 is a new mutation that is being recognized as a novel SARS. As of this writing, the current coronvirus has been attributed to over 4,000 deaths, the large majority among the elderly. In a recent press conference the Surgeon General remarked that the average age of deaths was 80.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prn.fm/can-natural-botanical-herbs-supplements-impact-coronavirus/\">Read More</a></p>\n</div>",

It is presumed that the sacred trust we project upon the authority and veneration of so-called “experts” should cancel out honest scrutiny and critical thinking. </p>\n<p>The logic behind this is simple and should be self evident, not just in the medical profession but for any field or discipline. Those who have obtained a coveted position of authority are expected to be blindly deferred to with the presumption that the top of the food chain is equivalent to being knowledgeable, insightful and correct. Consequently, a school teacher  may defer to the authority of an adjunct, who defers to a professor, who defers to a department chair, and further up the ladder to the Dean. But in the real world, these hierarchical differences of power and authority are more mythology than reality.</p>\n<p>One glaring example of a non-expert who has been uncritically praised and lifted as an authoritative voice for medical orthodoxy is former psychiatrist Stephen Barrett.

            "datePublished": "Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:01:18 -0400",
            "description": "<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Dear Dr. Gupta,</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">After watching you investigate health issues on CNN for the past 20+ years, I find it necessary to contact you about a situation related to CDC mandated vaccinations that has become very disturbing to me.  I am only hopeful that you might read this letter and become inspired to focus your investigative journalistic skills on this urgent matter. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">While I write this, I realize that the world is controlled by money and that there are things that you can investigate and those which are taboo.  Regardless of whether you can or cannot publicly comment on this matter, I would ask that you at least review my concerns and determine if the case against the CDC is legitimate.  Then I could come away believing that I did what I could to speak truth to power.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">I would like to focus your attention on a film that was released last year called, “<em>Deadly Deception</em>”.  I have enclosed a copy and hope you would take the time to review it.  This film brings many facts to light concerning the dangers posed by vaccinations that have never been widely available to public ears.  It also discloses corruption at the CDC and the infestation of pharmaceutical corporate interests upon that institution.  This entire film can also be seen at this link for free ></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=deadly+deception+gary+null&&view=detail&mid=B6837F652DA675D1D042B6837F652DA675D1D042&&FORM=VRDGAR&ru=%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddeadly%2Bdeception%2Bgary%2Bnull%26FORM%3DHDRSC3\">https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=deadly+deception+gary+null&&view=detail&mid=B6837F652DA675D1D042B6837F652DA675D1D042&&FORM=VRDGAR&ru=%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddeadly%2Bdeception%2Bgary%2Bnull%26FORM%3DHDRSC3</a>. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">The film is almost entirely composed of research and testimony from doctors who have had experience with illnesses related to vaccinations.  Accessing these people would make it very easy for you to investigate the claims they make.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">To possibly stoke your interest, I have summarized a lot of facts that were brought out in <u>the first half</u> of the film:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><u> </u></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><u>Deadly Deception</u>, a documentary film by Gary Null 2019.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight:400;\"><li>The CDC now requires that infants receive 49 doses of 16 vaccinations before the age of 6. </li>\n<li>Mercury has been proven to be extremely toxic – so much so – that dentists are even replacing tooth fillings that contain it, yet, mercury is still used in the flu shot, and even in maternal flu vaccinations. </li>\n<li>Because of the bad press related to mercury, the pharmaceutical industry has developed a nano-particulate form of aluminum.  This substance is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier and to lodge itself into the brain tissue.  This has been linked to many forms of chronic illness.</li>\n<li>Polysorbate 80 has never been tested as an human injectable, yet it is in vaccinations being injected into infants.</li>\n<li>The CDC manages a “VAERS” database that is not open to public review.  They are the sole repository of all information related to people who have been hurt and/or killed by vaccines, and as a result, are being compensated. </li>\n<li>It is estimated that the VAERS database is underreported by anywhere from 50:1 – 100:1.  So you would need to multiply the statistics in the database by 50 – 100 in order to get a realistic understanding of the true extent of the damage caused by vaccines.  The FDA, the CDC and the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons say that 90 – 99% of “<em>adverse events</em>” due to immunization are not even reported.  On that basis alone, no one should be required to subject themselves to vaccination.</li>\n<li>Because there is no requirement for the pharmaceutical industry or the CDC to publish the findings from the data in the VAERS database, doctors and pediatricians do not have access to information such as, symptoms, in order to quickly diagnose and treat illness due to a reaction to a vaccine.</li>\n<li>In a decision, the Supreme Court stated 32 times that vaccines are “<em>unavoidably unsafe</em>”.</li>\n<li>The studies that the FDA and the CDC require to verify the safety of new vaccines is totally inadequate by any normal medical standard.</li>\n<li>In 1986, the pharmaceutical industry lobbied to get legislation passed (1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act) that makes any manufacturer of a vaccine immune from prosecution due to harm done by its vaccinations – no matter how reckless or negligent the company was.  This made vaccine research and production immensely profitable.</li>\n<li>The law created the Federal Vaccine Compensation System, which created a schedule of known dangers related to each vaccine being strongly suggested to the population.  It set aside 75 cents on each vaccine dose dispensed to be put into a fund to compensate those who suffered injury or death from a reaction to a vaccine.   This is a federally funded program, which bars tracing liability back to the manufacturer.  This was supposed to be an alternative to a lawsuit – not instead of a lawsuit.  The pharmaceutical industry however argued that unbridled exposure to liability for damages would make research impossible so it was really a means of liquidated damages in the end.  Someone who loses a child, for example, is not entitled to sue the manufacturer, depose their professionals or conduct normal discovery to determine culpability.  It has become a “<em>Kangaroo Court</em>”.  The 1986 legislation has, essentially, turned the US Department of Justice into the lawyer for the vaccine industry.</li>\n<li>In court cases before the 1997 legislation, it had been determined that vaccinations cause encephalopathy (swelling of the brain), which lead to autism.  One cannot however bring a case for autism because the word autism is not included in the list of recognized billable diseases in the US healthcare system.  The healthcare system considers autism a disorder – not a disease.  This is how the pharmaceutical industry can say that there is no link between vaccination and autism.  It is a fraud and a dirty trick played by the US government in favor of the pharmaceutical industry.</li>\n<li>There is a victim compensation program that has paid out over $3 Billion during 27 years.  Just in 2016, it paid out over $251 million to people who are either killed or injured by vaccines.</li>\n<li>Many vaccines are only tested in animals.  They are prescribed to humans without any testing in many cases.</li>\n<li>The FDA and the CDC are not required to prove that a vaccine is effective in treating a disease.  They only have to show that the vaccine produces an antigen that is believed to be effective in combating a given disease.  Antibody production only relates to exposure, but not necessarily to immunity.  Many people, such as the disease-effected or elderly people won’t even generate the desired antibody.</li>\n<li>Many vaccines only produce temporary immunity, not a life-long immunity that would be a result of a normal function of the human immune system.  This is why so many vaccines require “<em>booster shots</em>”.</li>\n<li>CNN has reported that the US government secretly spread STD’s in South America between 1946-1948 to determine if injections of penicillin would reduce the likelihood of infection from sexually transmitted disease.</li>\n<li>The Nuremberg Code specifies that it is unlawful to force or coerce someone into taking medicine, receiving a vaccine or a medical procedure that he/she does not want.  State governments in the US however will require a prospective student to be fully vaccinated before that child will be permitted to attend school.  That is a direct example of coercion – which is a violation of the Nuremberg Code and the UNESCO Convention.</li>\n<li>Vaccines are now required for immigrants, for military troops, for military workers and government subcontractors.   They are also required for daycare facilities and for university enrollment.  State governments are “<em>partnering</em>” with corporations to mandate that their employees be vaccinated.</li>\n<li>Doctors and Hospitals have become enforcers of government policy where their medical licenses are subject to adherence to prescribed protocols for vaccinations to infants.  This violates the patient/doctor relationship.</li>\n<li>The vaccine market will be worth 100 Billion US by 2025 thanks to government enforcement of its vaccination protocols.</li>\n<li>There is a concept of “<em>Hurd Immunity</em>” that says that if you vaccinate 95% of a population, you have created a barrier to the spread of a disease.  However, in 1997 there was an outbreak of measles in Corpus Christi, Texas in a community that had more than a 95% vaccination rate.  The children that got measles had their blood sampled to verify antibody levels.  93% of them had sufficient antibody levels to theoretically prevent infection – yet they got infected anyway.  Hurd Immunity is therefore a belief system that is used to promote the mandating of vaccination and not a proven scientific theory.</li>\n<li>Some studies have been done that even indicate that people vaccinated with the measles vaccine are MORE likely to come down with the infection.  In this study, the few who were not vaccinated did NOT contract measles.  In fact, a vaccinated kid could still be carrying the germ.</li>\n<li>The rise of autism and other related disorders has caused an epidemic of special education burden on the US education system.  The US taxpayer will be forced to pay for these services.  This is tantamount to a huge transfer of wealth from the public sector to the pharmaceutical industry.  It is profiting from the immunization program, while at the same time, producing a large population of people who will never be able to contribute to the economy.</li>\n<li>The US government subsidizes research & development for vaccines and then puts pressure on state governments to require its use.  A speaker in the film says, <em>“this has got to be one of the biggest rackets on the planet</em>.”</li>\n<li>There have been four separate studies by the United States Government including a three year study by Congress, a one year study by the Senate, a study conducted by HHS of itself in 2008 and a study in 2018 by the Office of Research Integrity – all of which describe the vaccine division at CDC as a “<em>cesspool of corruption</em>” because of financial conflicts of interest between individuals that work in the vaccine division and those who work in the vaccine industry.</li>\n<li>The Gardasil vaccine – the National Institute of Health buys the patent from MERC, which is recommended by the Center of Disease Control, which is approved by the FDA and the court that will decide if that vaccine has hurt your child is the Heath Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  <u>All four of those sister agencies are part of Health and Human Services Department</u>.  The intrinsic conflict of interest in this process is not made known to the public.  The CDC has therefore become the promoter of vaccines on behalf of MERC, a privately-owned pharmaceutical industry player.  This is not the role of government.</li>\n<li>The CDC will allow “<em>wash out periods</em>” during trials of new vaccines.  They have also been known to have disregarded data that did not deliver the results that they are seeking and have fabricated studies.  They have hired criminals to misrepresent data and to create false stories that are fed to the media.  The experts that the CDC has used to defend their practices were those who were used to disprove the effects of Agent Orange back in the 1980’s shielding the US Government and the chemical manufacturer from liability to the US veterans and the Vietnamese who’s lives were altered or shortened by it.  Their value is knowing how to lie using data as a tool for deception. </li>\n<li>The CDC has little technical legitimacy, since they are immune from having to publicly prove anything, yet they have the ability to impose “<em>medical martial law</em>” on the population.</li>\n<li>The documentary states that corporately owned media outlets are

that there is definitely a connection between the Thimerosal vaccine and Autism – as well as many other disorders such as speech delay, learning disabilities and ADD.  In this meeting, they discussed how to massage the data to remove the connection between the two.  The rest of the meeting was devoted to discussing how they would hide this from the press.  A CDC researcher had found that if a

However, when skepticism itself becomes a doctrine unto itself, then a large body of scientific evidence that convincingly takes authority to task is simply denied or aggressively denounced.  Surrendering critical thinking and healthy skepticism to authority figures and institutions more often than not sidelines both the scientific and social need for an open and honest debate that can bring forth evidence that challenges the rule and control of a dominant authoritative view.  Of course, many of the most radical scientific voices in the past who challenged authoritative paradigms were marked heretics, such as Galileo and Newton. And inevitably with the passage of time, the mavericks were proven correct.   Today the pariahs of the dominant scientific order include Deepak Chopra, Rupert Sheldrake, Nobel Laureates Brian Josephson and Luc Montagnier, and numerous medical professionals who have had the courage to look outside the glass walls of the dominant medical paradigm.  But worse, when skepticism surrenders its own reasoning in order to proselytize an ideology or dogma then it risks being a very real danger to society. In effect, it becomes a fundamentalist cult.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p> <u></u><u></u></p>\n<p>Modern Skepticism, as a movement within the sciences, has become a pseudo-science better known as Scientism.  The extreme radicalized New Atheism, represented by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Coyne, Steven Novella, etc is a natural outcome of Scientism's false certainty in its own absolute and rigid beliefs that have been transformed into rational objectivity. <u></u><u></u></p>\n<p> </p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>To Save the Planet and Sustain Your Health, Become a Vegan</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">On Sunday evening, the Academy Award recipient Joachim Phoenix gave an extraordinary speech. He spoke about his personal dark side he had struggled with in the past, and how the movie industry and his peers in cinema gave him a second chance.  It was an affirmation of redemption.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">For those of us in the vegan movement, Phoenix's speech was heartwarming and emblematic of the kind or revelations that emerge when a person realizes the violence from which their meat in a meal originates. It is food from a living, sentient being.  He gave the image of a mother cow giving birth to an infant calf and the mother crying for days as her calf was taken away.  Other celebrities, either in attendance or absent, have already reached this realization, such as Natalie Portman, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Pfeiffer, Woody Harrelson, director James Cameron, Daryl Hannah, Paul McCartney and many others.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Today, the science is clear. There are hundreds of reliable peer-reviewed studies supporting the benefits of a Mediterranean or a healthy plant-based diet for relieving and treating disease, including a variety of cancers. On the other side of the equation, there are equally many studies that have determined unhealthy foods such as meat contributing to cancer,  heart disease, diabetes, obesity and inflammatory illnesses such as arthritis. If we focus solely upon health issues, then disease and premature death are on the side of a meat-based lifestyle.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Some people care more about the environment than they do about themselves. Consequently their concerns about the largess of the meat industry is that it is energy intensive. The water necessary to grow a plot of potatoes compared to a hamburger is astronomical. Weaning ourselves off of meat reduces global warming because the billions of animals raised annually for human consumption increases greenhouse gas emissions, notably methane.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">If you do not feel this is particularly important, then consider the frightening event of Antarctica reaching 67 degrees F earlier this month. For the last three years, the southern continent has had the highest temperatures every recorded.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Therefore, every bite counts.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">There is also today a growing movement to purchase organic  plant-based food that is raised locally. This is in part because there is a highly educated class of Millennials and X-Generation who realize the importance of a healthy diet for sustaining a healthy body.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">But what is perhaps equally important is to investigate and understand where our information for making wise choices comes from. Who inspires us to seek the truth? And that is why Phoenix's speech was so necessary at this time.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Throughout our lives we have two principle kinds of mentors who guide us. First, there are the policymakers. These are our parents when we are  young, school teachers when we are learning, and then when we enter society there are the captains of industry whether it is the CEO of a telecommunication company such as Verizon or any of the other large corporate entities. These are the people who establish and often write policies. From the policymakers, information trickles down through think tanks, foundations, public relations firms, lobbyists and politicians. And the media is their primary echo chamber.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">The second mentor are opinion leaders. These are the people who are in the public eye and who often generate a large following.  Average people look up to them as role models and examples of what they assume is appropriate behavior. These are the people who are thought to \"be in the know,\" ahead of the curves and who drive future trends. Sometimes they work endlessly, such as the basketball star LeBron James who inspires thousands of kids but then also represents Nike products.  Or a popular actress who speaks on behalf of a cosmetic product to sell a solution for perfect skin. There are thousands of such motivational speakers in politics, athletics, entertainment, corporate culture and the media who have been acknowledged for their success.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">So when we think of a famous person as an opinion leader who becomes a vegan, there will be a sizeable number of people who will follow their advice and example.  The largest increase in the vegan movement occurs when a person who people admire acts by example and explains why it is so important to stop the suffering of animals.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Bravo for Joachim. Let us hope that others in the audience and viewers will come forward and join the effort. It only takes about 3.5 percent of the population to support any given cause in order to change the course of policymakers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Important Vegan Facts to Consider</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">What if I told you that going on an incredibly delicious, cost-effective plant-based diet would:</p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Reduce your risk of all cancers by 50%,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Decrease your chance of developing diabetes by 50% and eliminate Type 2 diabetes,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Drop your chance of developing heart disease by 24%, reduce your chance of dying from heart disease by 29% or if you have heart disease, reduce future cardiac events by 73%,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Lower your risk of colon cancer by 40%,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Have an 80% chance of reducing arthritis symptoms in less than four weeks,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Assist you in losing a minimum of one pound of body weight per week until you reach your goal, and without exercising (although I recommend exercising too),</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Significantly lower high blood pressure and unhealthy cholesterol levels,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Double the number of natural “killer cells” in the body, thereby increasing the strength of your immune system,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Significantly lessen your likelihood of being obese,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Help you have leaner, healthier children,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Improve your sleep, your sex life, and your complexion,</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Give you more energy than you have ever had, and, most importantly, add quality years onto your life</li>\n</ul><p style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition, despite the lack of action in the US, there are nations and major cities around the world taking climate change seriously. Visionaries and scientists are creating unique and wonderful innovations in renewable energy to challenge America's hubris, denial, and complacency. Rather than descending into apathy, withdrawing into isolation and being unwilling to face these problems, we might consider optimistic strategies for how we can individually and collectively make a difference. And the foremost effort each of us can begin at this very moment is to adopt a healthy, plant-based diet. Not only is it affordable, but a vegan lifestyle will also strengthen our physical and mental health to face the challenges ahead. It is the single most important thing each of us can do to save the planet.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">What if I also told you that in one year of eating this way, you would save the lives of approximately 400 animals (fish and shellfish included), plus, you would save 300,000 gallons of water, nearly 90,000 pounds of grain (which could go to feed humans), and more than 5,700 gallons of gasoline, all while generating 50% fewer carbon emissions? You would also end your contribution through dietary choices to depleting rainforests, eroding topsoil, world hunger, and global warming, while standing for cleaner air, cleaner water in aquifers, rivers, lakes, and oceans, cleaner drinking water, the humane treatment of animals and humans, and the health of any number of species and the planet too.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:400;\">Would you want to hear about it? Moreover, would you be interested in knowing that millions—and a growing number—of people in our country and around the world are choosing this diet and lifestyle right now, and for the very reasons  just pointed out?</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Science Based Medicine: A Swamp of Medical Buffoonery </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Richard Gale </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Progressive Radio Network, February 6, 2020</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Every religion, large institution, political party and scientific and social discipline has its lunatic fringe.  Within the practice of medicine in the 21st century the aberrant margins are the far extremes of alternative medical beliefs and the small clique of Science Based Medicine (SBM) within the conventional medical establishment. While the former is completely unsupported by any credible science, the latter is plagued by rampant shortsightedness, professional bias and hubris, and outright disdain towards all medical therapies that do not fall within the purview of its worldview of uncompromising scientific reductionism. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Unfortunately, despite its small following, the leading SBM voices have succeeded in having an enormous detrimental influence over the narrative of healthcare and the freedom of medical choice in the social media, including Wikipedia. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Society of Science Based Medicine is the brainchild of Dr. Steven Novella at Yale University with the loyal support of his colleagues Drs. David Gorski (an oncologist at Wayne State University) and Harriet Hall. SBM blogs -- the Science Based Medicine blog, Neurologia and Respectful Insolence -- have functioned as clearing houses of opinions for the modern Skeptic organizations to source opinionated and prejudiced essays in their efforts to criticize and debunk alternative and natural medical therapies, including those that have received mainstream acceptance in the field of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).  A brief visit to the SBM blog will reveal that approximately 90 percent of its content is savage, cirumlocutory and scientifically shoddy attacks against non-conventional medicine and those who practice these natural therapies. For the most part its articles represent personal opinions rather than rigorous scientific inquiry. And the site largely serves Skeptics on the internet and Wikipedia to fuel them with ammunition in their anti-CAM campaigns.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">SBM's David Gorski's articles are unquestionably the most entertaining albeit flagrantly bombastic.  In a recent article sharing his despair over the rise in CAM's popularity within the conventional medical community, he writes, </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"As much as I hate to admit it, at times I feel like Sisyphus, pushing the boulder up the hill only to have it roll down the other side, only to have to push it back up the hill and roll down again, over and over and over again for all eternity. Certainly trying to keep track of pseudoscience in medicine and trying to educate why so much of so-called “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) is quackery (and the stuff that isn’t quackery is just medicine rebranded as CAM) and why “integrative medicine” involves integrating quackery with medicine can seem like a very Sisyphean task.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This is classic Gorski. Yet perhaps it is an indication that he may suffer from a savior complex. Does he believe he holds a prophetic mission to warn against the very bad bogey women and bogey men in the alternative and natural health communities who are determined to force upon the public vitamins, supplements, medicinal herbs, healthy diets, and alternative and natural medical therapies for personal gain? Rather than allow Gorski to wallow in the self pity of his eternal fate to battle effective natural medical treatments with his quarry, might his burden be lessened by bolting the boulder on his back? </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Conspiratorial paranoia, scientific denialism and the lack of critical thought abound in Skeptic and SBM publications. It is witnessed in SBM's unwavering defense of genetically modified foods, fluoride, and vaccines. There's Novella's defense of the endocrine disruptor Biphenol A (BPA), the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup), synthetic chemical sweeteners, and more recently the telecommunication industry's talking points about the safety of electromagnetic radiation from cell phones and the coming 5G \"internet of things.\" Over the years SBM authors have attacked a gluten-free diet (aside from the 1 percent of people who have Celiac disease), state licensing of acupuncturists and naturopaths, plant-based diets, nutritional therapies and the Keto Diet for mental disorders, omega-3 and other dietary supplements, antioxidants, etc. In the SBM universe, with few exceptions, only pharmaceutical drugs and surgery should define the practice of medicine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Given Novella's positions noted above, it comes as no surprise that we find him serving as an Advisory Board member for the American Council on Science and Health, a pro-industry front organization with financial ties to Chevron and ExxonMobil, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, McDonalds, Bristol Myers, Proctor and Gamble, almost all of the agricultural giants including Bayer, Monsanto, DowAgra, Syngenta and tobacco companies such as Altria, Reynolds American, Phillip Morris and British American Tobacco.  Surely this is the real quackery of junk science that poses the greatest threat to public health and costing the lives of millions of the planet's citizens.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Least worrisome is SBM's reliance upon cherry-picked science (often infected by corporate conflicts of interest), its scientific arguments against CAM (largely irrational and based upon the flawed theory of \"plausibility\"), and an ideological belief system (i.e., Skepticism) that strictly adheres to a dominant medical institution that we now find cracking at the seams. Once SBM's rhetoric is fully understood it echoes as an exasperated last breath effort to keep alive the failures of Herbert Spencer's, Marx's and the founder of scientism August Comte's nineteenth century scientific materialism. And unless SBM receives imperial decree, there is very little chance this fringe movement will gain much popularity nor have any constructive  impact within the medical community. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Skeptic proponents of SBM seem determined to prevent medicine from evolving beyond its current reductionist, materialist perspective. For that reason SBM's followers adamantly oppose funding research that may someday explain why and how alternative healing modalities have been successful for countless people worldwide. Consequently Skeptics are the strongest opponents of the growing trend in CAM therapies entering medical school curriculums and being offered in hospitals and clinical settings. In recent years, the American Medical Students Association has sponsored an Integrative Medicine Day.  Novella and Gorski have damned this effort as \"quackademic medicine\" and have </span><a href=\"http://everything.explained.today/David_Gorski/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">published articles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> excoriating the study of natural health treatments as a threat to science.  Writing for the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">New York Times</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, health journalist </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/jimmy-wales-is-not-an-internet-billionaire.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">David Freedman called</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> these medical Skeptics \"prickly anti-alternative medicine warriors.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However what is far more vexing is SBM's religious zealotry to discredit any and all alternative medical practices it does not agree with. This is best displayed by these authors' consistent use of demeaning language and exhibiting a narcissistic sense of intellectual superiority. More often, we might find ourselves questioning their state of mind and lack of reasonable integrity. For example, SBM advocates are readily adverse to the precautionary principle. Once they grasp on to a belief, such as the non-toxicity of fluoride or glyphosate, this belief rapidly morphs into dogma despite the evidence to the contrary.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But modern medicine's increasing acceptance of CAM therapies, according to Gorski, is a trend to mourn. </span><a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/nccih-surveys-physicians/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In his article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> \"NCCIH Surveys Physicians on Their Recommendations of 'Complementary Health Approaches,' with Depressing Results,\" he opines over a press release by the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health that reported,</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"More than half of office-based physicians recommend at least one complementary health approach to their patients, according to a new analysis of data from a nationally representative survey. In addition, female physicians recommended every complementary health approach at a higher rate than male physicians except for chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation.\" </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The remainder of Gorski's article is a criticism of the report's underlying message and then reshaping facts into SBM's own image. It is intellectual alchemy that only unveils a deep seated callowness and animosity towards natural health and those who practice it. Gorksi states that it bothers him \"that so many physicians recommend vitamins and supplements,\" and it bothers him more \"that so many physicians recommend acupuncture (22.4%), homeopathy (12.6%), and naturopathy (10.4%).\" David, we are delighted you are bothered! Welcome to the evolutionary changes happening within modern medicine that finally woke to the volumes of research Skeptics categorically ignore and deny. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Seemingly Gorski and Novella want to carry medicine back to the days of the Flexner report at the beginning of the last century when modern medicine first turned tyrannical to appease industrial giants such as Carnegie and Rockefeller.   </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Gorski writes,</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"... if you don’t understand that naturopathy is a hodgepodge of pseudoscience and quackery mixed with some sensible interventions based on diet and lifestyle (although, truth be told, even the science-based interventions used by naturopaths are usually tainted with pseudoscience), you should not be a physician</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Regarding acupuncture, he writes,</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"Many years ago, I once thought there might be something to acupuncture. The more I read, the more I studied it, though, the more I realized that it’s just a theatrical placebo and that its only effects are nonspecific placebo effects.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">And the more I read SBM articles and these lengthy diatribes attacking the advances in alternative health, the more I realize that Gorski, Novella, et al. may be living in an alternative universe. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Finally David concludes,</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"In reality, this study is very much like every other NCCIH study examining CAM usage: Its function is marketing, not “to inform”. Expect it to be used to argue how popular CAM is, how many doctors accept it, and thus to argue to policymakers and insurance companies that CAM should be reimbursable by government and private health insurance plans.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">And here we rediscover one of SBM's favorite conspiracies; that is, everyone practicing alternative medicine is a hustler and charlatan selling placebos and snake oil for profit and personal gain. It is beyond belief that these folks fail to consider the possibility that because there are tens of thousands of alternative health practitioners serving millions of clients and patients it might have something to do with the success and effectiveness of these healing modalities. I realize that this may be a difficult stunt for a Skeptic brain to comprehend, but it is a very simple and common sense possibility they may wish to consider.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One among many glaring reasons why there has been a large uptick of interest in CAM, both within the medical profession and among the public, is the loss of trust in conventional medicine. This has nothing to do with CAM advertizing or propaganda as SBM skeptics want us to believe. Instead it is a sign of the increasing failures in our medical system. Drug companies' claims are no longer trustworthy. The federal health agencies consistently betray us by fast-tracking drugs that only shortly thereafter need to be stamped with a black box warning. For decades the industry has become a profitable machine sourcing false promises about the latest medications to hit the market. Its court fines for engaging in unethical or illegal activities grow annually. And conventional medicine's graveyard of victims is many square miles larger than the tiny land plot of casualties that may be attributed to CAM.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If we undertake a thought experiment to carry SBM's principles, criticisms and beliefs to their ultimate conclusion, what might modern medicine look like through the eyes of an SBM Skeptic? SBM imagines itself to be the new paradigm of conventional medicine that will replace the current widely accepted \"evidence-based medicine\" model. It hails itself as the future paradigm for evaluating medical research and to recommend best practices and treatments. Yet its failure lies in contributing absolutely no original research to improve the practice of medicine. Rather, as I have noted above, SBM is a repository of sarcasm, mean-spiritedness and criticism. It is a harbinger of a medical Inquisition in its witch hunt to defame CAM practitioners and their therapies. Therefore if a curse from the heavens were to fall upon America's healthcare and SBM proponents were to take control over national healthcare policies and medical schools, what might our healthcare system develop into? Based upon what we can surmise and extract from the numerous articles on the SBM websites, what would be our options for freedom of medical choice?  How accessible would natural and alternative health therapies be for patients?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Below is the list I compiled that is based upon conclusions I have drawn from SBM articles criticizing CAM therapies and other health-related topics:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Defund and discontinue the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (CAM);</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Cease government research grants for alternative health modalities and therapies;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Discontinue CAM courses in medical schools and discourage education in CAM therapies at universities;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Chiropractic practice would be limited to only a small number of health indications and would not be covered by insurance plans. Access to Chiropractic services, therefore, would be strictly out of pocket;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Similarly, acupuncture could only be provided for a small number of medical indications and would likely require a physician's recommendation or prescription;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Vitamin supplements would be removed as over-the-counter products and put into the hands of pharmaceutical companies;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many supplements, or all supplements, would require a doctor's prescription;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">All dietary and nutritional counseling must conform to the terribly outdated standards set forth by the American Dietetic Association, which represents mainstream pharmaceutical interests; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">No state could authorize Naturopathic medical board certifications, and current states that recognize Naturopathic practice would have permissions revoked;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The large majority of botanical medicines would no longer be available, and likely not purchasable over the counter;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The practice of homeopathy would be outlawed and the sale of homeopathic remedies would be banned;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Indian Ayurveda, and Energy Medicine (e.g. Reiki, polarity therapy, therapeutic touch, emotional freedom technique) would be prohibited;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A nationwide moratorium would be set to prohibit the labeling of genetically modified foods (GMOs);</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Water from public utilities and dental products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash, would be required to contain fluoride;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Vaccination for all children and adults would be mandated at a national level and children could be vaccinated without parental approval. Failure to comply could result in outrageous fines or criminal proceedings.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Finally, all sites focused on alternative health, plant-based diets and natural nutrition, vaccination hesitancy, dangers of electromagnetic radiation, GMOs risks, etc would be strictly censored.</span></li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Undoubtedly, this list may appear to be unduly extreme and perhaps unfair; nevertheless, I believe it accurately reflects the condemnations and hate-mongering found scattered throughout SBM and Skeptic blogs and articles. Skeptics disproportionately ridicule CAM while at the same time fail to critically evaluate their own medical profession's rickety research that finds its way into peer-reviewed medical journals. Furthermore, this is the same scenario subtly being promoted by the Skeptics on Wikipedia's alternative health pages who are in the habit of referencing Gorski, Novella and other SBM authors in addition to SBM's predecessor Stephen Barrett and Quackwatch. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If my list is accurate, it portrays a regime that may best be defined as medical fascism.  In my opinion SBM should never be perceived as a champion of public health. Rather it is an ideological cancer. Its authors are master wordsmiths who use the language of science to tailor the illusion of Science-Based Medicine as a new gold standard; nevertheless, it is only a ruse to confuse the public and to restore the dying Flexner paradigm of modern medicine that should be buried alongside its millions of victims.</span></p>\n<p> </p>",

Major news outlets and news papers, such as the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, and television news networks will also have independent fact checkers who review and vet content to validate the content's accuracy.  One media source that has risen to become one of the world's most popular resources for information, used by more people than all of the major American newspapers combined, is Wikipedia.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p class=\"m_-3816224734953039352xmsonormal\">However, unlike mainstream journalism, Wikipedia does not pass the smell test of being legitimately credible. Editors and writers are more often than not anonymous. Their background, expertise and scholarship on any given subject are largely unknown. This is especially the case for many of Wikipedia's pages dealing with Alternative and Complementary Medicine (CAM) and the personal biographies of CAM's leading practitioners and advocates. Moreover, although Wikipedia has strict rules for determining what are reliable and unreliable resources for sourcing citations, these guidelines are often not adhered to or intentionally ignored altogether.  Instead, many sources relied upon to discredit CAM and non-conventional medical doctors and practitioners are dubious at best. In some cases they are solely resources publishing ideological propaganda and personal opinions.</p>",

All vaccines, we are told, have been proven safe, either individually or in combination, and this has been thoroughly researched in clinical trials.  This absolutism within the medical and pharmacological communities, including the American Pediatric Association, also argues that they are the sole experts. Because they have found no reason to question the virtues of vaccination, neither should the public and media. Therefore, the debate is closed.

However, if the information you seek concerns non-conventional medical practices that fall under the category of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, or traditional healing systems, such as Chiropractic, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, homeopathy, acupuncture, traditional Chinese and Indian Ayurveda medicine, massage therapy, etc, then you will fall into deep doubt regarding their efficacy. Wikipedia's senior and administrative editors hold the unequivocal opinion that all of these medical modalities are pseudoscience and quackery. They have no merit . Nor do those who practice and advocate for them, who are privately characterized as \"lunatic charlatans.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What authority do Wikipedia's Skeptic editors have to make these claims and condemn entire fields of medicine that are now increasing and gaining popularity?  One name and organization stands out on Wikipedia's alternative health pages: Stephen Barrett and his organization Quackwatch. For the past four decades, Barrett and his Skeptic colleagues have waged an endless crusade to discourage people from even considering the legitimacy of these natural therapies. Clearly, if you take a moment to read Quackwatch articles, you will immediately discover extreme bias. In addition, Barrett and his network rely upon very limited and outdated research to make wide sweeping generalizations that are pointedly scientifically unsound and often absurd.</span></p>",

            "datePublished": "Tue, 10 Dec 2019 15:55:34 -0400",
            "description": "<p><strong>Modern Skepticism: An Authentic Pseudoscience of Irrational Deception</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Progressive Radio Network, December 10, 2019</strong></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many of us working in healthcare professions believe that medical science, in theory, is at a transformative moment.  Hundreds of thousands of scientists and physicians worldwide are conducting basic and applied research into the mechanisms for altering the genomic blueprint to help prevent genetically vulnerable illnesses.  This is applicable for helping repair damaged eyes, lungs, brain, liver, kidneys, muscles. etc. These researchers are frequently funded by universities and private industries amounting to billions of dollars. Having been invited to present my own anti-aging data at many international conferences, I have discovered that these scientists speak with an enthusiasm towards the progress being made to eventually reverse much of the physical and mental damage caused by our lifestyle, diet, attitude and behaviors.  At a Chicago anti-aging conference where I gave a keynote presentation on research the late neurologist and former Mt Sinai physician Dr. Martin Feldman and I conducted to naturally improve mental wellness and reduce problematic symptoms in menopausal women, there were thousands of board certified doctors and scientists in attendance, many from our most prestigious institutions. Following our presentation, they were eager to learn about the non-drug protocols we employed in our clinical trials. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Every physician and healer is not starting their journey in anti-aging and alternative medicine from the same launching point. That is why these conferences are so important. Organizations such as the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) are particularly open and accepting of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and the new discoveries emerging from epigenetic research. According to A4M's co-founders Drs. Robert Goldman and Ron Klatz, their organization has approximately 26,000 active members who have published countless articles in peer-reviewed publications. These academicians and physicians, are not quacks, but represent many of our leading medical institutions such as Harvard, Chicago and Yale. Worldwide its membership represents 120 countries and hosts dozens of international anti-aging conferences annually. Moreover, the A4M has trained upwards to 150,000 physicians through their anti-aging certification programs, now recognized by the American Medical Association. Yet rarely do we ever hear about these advances and their leading institutions in the mainstream media. On the other hand, Wikipedia's entry for A4M is full of ridicule and cherry picked references to discredit its value and successes. Because many physicians and researchers in the field of anti-aging medicine advocate natural hormone therapies, dietary regimens, supplemental therapies, exercise and lifestyle changes, Wikipedia editors make efforts to characterize the organization as a promoter of pseudo-science and quackery. Granted, the threats this field poses to the trillion dollar drug industry are very real. It is a move away from our now dominant drug-based paradigm. Nevertheless, this is the future of medicine and healthcare we are moving towards. Unfortunately there are very powerful, reactionary and regressive forces who believe it is their mission to halt scientific progress and maintain the status quo of Big Pharma's reign over our healthcare system. Without the science on their side, these radicalized factions, as we shall see, have resorted to malicious attacks, defamation, and acts of shaming alternative health practitioners and researchers as enemies of the public, \"lunatic charlatans\" and quacks. And this is all permissible on Wikipedia because the evidence seems clear that the encyclopedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales espouses this faction's discriminatory philosophy. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Today, more than ever, people are confused about what is true or false for issues that have an immediate impact upon their lives, health and well-being.  Global warming. Is it a hoax or will there be apocalyptic events during our lifetimes? Is the economy booming and job growth rising as the White House and the mainstream media would like us to believe, or are we only being given a thin slice of the actual picture?  For health and medical matters, the noise is even louder. Is a plant-based diet optimal for my health, or can I continue to subsist on burgers and junk food? Do I need supplements to maximize my health or I am throwing money away? Are most diseases really caused by genetic anomalies?  Is this treatment my physician prescribes the best for my condition, or is there a safer and more effective alternative? These are legitimate questions. What we do not know is who is being truthful. To find answers, patients increasingly turn to the internet. Wikipedia, for example, has become the leading source to find answers for medical questions. But is this information reliable? </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Unfortunately, on health matters, we place too much unwarranted trust in sites such as the CDC, WebMD and Wikipedia. The average person, including most professionals, accept what they read on face value and fail to undertake any deeper investigation into the legitimacy of the claims found therein. Our own investigations during the past two years have shown that Wikipedia's information for many medical and health topics, especially regarding non-conventional medical or Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), is consistently misleading and often deliberately fictitious.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Throughout history there have been reactionary movements and groups of individuals who have attempted to impose their personal ideologies, as an act of self-righteous defiance, upon the public in order to shape public opinion.  In recent times we have seen this scenario being played out by government war-hawks and neo-cons eager to topple Middle Eastern governments, the agro-chemical industry and corporate giants such as Monsanto to usurp hegemonic control over our food supply, and the Wall Street elite making every effort to take advantage of federal loopholes for personal gain at citizens' expense. Another area is the full-spectrum dominance -- a complete control over public discourse and legislative policy -- by the private pharmaceutical complex, including our bloated for-profit insurance industry, to rule over the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  In short, today, our health is largely at the mercy of whatever the pharmaceutical industry offers and dictates. To step outside this regime, and to act upon the freedom of health choice, therefore has to be done on one's own efforts and costs. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Yet there are other specters behind pharmaceutical interests who with or without intention make efforts to undermine the pharmaceutical paradigm's competition. Today, public health is being seriously threatened by an international movement, however for the most part being orchestrated in the US, that purports to be non-partisan, independent and based solely on evidence based science.  It has also initiated a successful propaganda agenda that has managed to keep the larger public completely unaware.This movement known as Skepticism has managed to grow and infiltrate university departments, Silicon Valley firms, the internet -- notably the open-source encyclopedia Wikipedia -- the popular TED talks, and major publications, news sources and the media without any honest or serious scrutiny nor investigation into its underlying premises and motives.  Under its bombast of claims to serve consumer protection, Skepticism's war against CAM to the contrary is premised on serious fallacious arguments, irrational beliefs and a systemic sanctimonious hubris that upon closer examination reveals it is perhaps one of the greatest threats to the advancement of science and the democratic dignity of human beings.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There is nothing particularly new in what Skepticism exemplifies. We can look back at history to find other extremist attempts by a medical elite to achieve institutional prominence and to extinguish its competition. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In 1910, the Flexner Report was published.  The report was commissioned by the newly founded American Medical Association and funded by elite industrialists at the time such as Andrew Carnegie and the Rockefeller Foundation. Its mission was to advance the emerging drug-based medical model in medical school curricula and to eradicate its competitors, including homeopathy, naturopathy, eclectic therapy, physical therapy, osteopathy and Chiropractic.  Before the Report's release, medical schools, with very few exceptions, offered most of these non-drug based natural therapies alongside manufactured medications. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543812/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The consequence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> was that over 80 percent of medical schools teaching alternative therapies were shut down. For the Carnegies, Rockefellers and other industrial elite, a drug-based medical system promised enormous investment opportunities in the growing corporate drug industry to increase profits that natural medical therapies could not provide.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Abraham Flexner, the Report's author and primary ringleader, may be the original radicalized Skeptic and the forefather of modern Skepticism's adversity against all non-conventional medical therapies practiced today.  Similar to Skeptic editors on Wikipedia, </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543812/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Flexner called</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> the practitioners of these disciplines -- which he characterized as \"medical sects\" -- \"charlatans\" and \"quacks.\"  Modern Skeptics are the de facto inheritors of Flexner's reactionary medical extremism. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One could argue that the Flexner report was an attempt to establish a \"gold standard\" along the scientific lines at that time in order to create a dominant medical paradigm for the new 20th century. However, 110 years later, such a gold standard has never been met. Commenting on the long term results of Flexner's experiment, Yale Medical School professor Thomas Duffy </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178858/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">remarked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"There was maldevelopment in the structure of medical education in America in the aftermath of the Flexner Report. The profession’s infatuation with the hyper-rational world of German medicine created an excellence in science that was not balanced by a comparable excellence in clinical caring. Flexner’s corpus was all nerves without the life blood of caring.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It is in this critical omission where Flexner's, and now Skepticism's, socio-economic experiment fails. On the other hand, clinical caring and customized medical attention is an area in which alternative medical remedies excel. According to Duke University's </span><a href=\"https://dukeintegrativemedicine.org/about/what-is-integrative-medicine/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">definition of Integrative Medicine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, it is </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"an approach to care that puts the patient at the center and addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental influences that affect a person's health. Employing a personalized strategy that considers the patient's unique conditions, needs and circumstances, it uses the most appropriate interventions from an array of scientific disciplines [including natural, non-drug interventions alongside allopathic practice] to heal illness and disease and help people regain and maintain optimum health.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Skepticism categorically denies the legitimacy of Duke University's claim, and this is further reinforced on Wikipedia's pages for alternative medical therapies. In fact, Skepticism and Wikipedia are today's regressive and scientifically-arrested response to the new directions taking hold in the evolution of accepted medical theory, albeit still in its early stage.  Skeptics are not shy to voice their disdain for federal health agencies and medical schools' efforts to support effective, non-toxic and safe natural therapies into the mainstream, including naturopathy, dietetic and nutritional therapies, acupuncture, a variety of massage and mind-body therapies, stress reduction techniques (e.g., meditation, yoga, tai chi) and other ancient practices predating Flexner's purge.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nor would Skeptics support a recent World Health Organization report that confirmed Traditional and natural alternative medical systems as \"an important and often underestimated health resource with many applications, especially in the prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases.\" In addition, the WHO Director General stated that these non-conventional traditional medical practices are essential for sustaining healthcare and are a \"human right.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Now that modern medical error has risen to the third leading cause of premature deaths in the US, conventional medical protocols taught in medical schools across the nation can be judged as a dismal failure. In addition, the public is quickly losing confidence in the medical profession.  Last year, a </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">New York Times</span></em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/upshot/do-you-trust-the-medical-profession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">piece reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that only 34 percent of the public trust medical doctors and 25 percent trust our current healthcare system; this is an enormous decrease compared to 75 percent in 1966. As for public trust in our federal health agencies, it stands at a miserable 14 percent. For that very reason, the alternative medical systems the Flexner rules intended to stamp out are regaining their rightful place in healthcare and now being reincorporated into medical school curricula, hospitals and physician clinics because of their much lower risk. The remainder of the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">New York Times</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> article is utter nonsense and comes to the defense of the pharmaceutical industry to account for this growing lack of trust. In the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Time</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">'s opinion, it is those patients who do not follow the drug regimens and procedures religiously that are to blame. If they were to continue to follow their physicians' advice, they would restore their trust. Well we must give it to the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Times</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> for its ingenuity to consistently conjure foolish logic! </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The decline in the public's trust of conventional medicine begs a serious question. May this be an indication that more Americans are waking up to the fact that many of the medical establishment's therapeutic promises and protocols are scientifically baseless and not dependable?  Are the real quacks perhaps those graduating from our medical schools after having been unknowingly fully indoctrinated by a drug-dominant paradigm? It is no secret that almost every American medical school has been hijacked to a greater or lesser degree by corporate pharmaceutical interests. More than ever before medical institutions depend economically on funding from our compromised federal agencies and private industry. It is not uncommon to find pharmaceutical officers and drug sales representatives invited to lecture or even teach courses.  Conventional medical education has become a singular revolving door with drug companies that have deep financial interests for commanding power over every day clinical practice. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As public trust continues to diminish, Skepticism has become the advance guard, the shock troops, to preserve the delusional and aberrant purity in a drug- and surgical-based medical paradigm that Flexner, Carnegie and Rockefeller hoped would become the final barometer for a national healthcare system. While purporting to be rational, Skepticism at the same time is incapable of ascertaining other forms of scientific value as well as non-scientific truths, such as ethical and moral, metaphysical and aesthetic truths. Although the scientific method is completely incapable of either confirming or disproving these other truths, they nevertheless also follow a certain reason and logic every bit as rigorous as evidence-based science.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Although modern Skepticism can be said to have found its place as a powerful voice in the scientific community during the nineteenth century, it has become more radicalized and militant during the past several decades. This radicalization has increased because Skeptics largely go unchallenged by the scientific profession and media. Rarely do we find any leading publication taking Skeptic claims to task. Since Skeptics believe they represent the pinnacle of rationalism and the scientific method, many of the movement's celebrity leaders and principal organizations, Quackwatch and the Center for Inquiry, they have taken on the mission to redeem modern civilization from thousands of years of religious history, superstition and earlier traditional medical practices that rely upon botanical plants or that incorporate a more mind-body systems-theory philosophy for understanding the etiology and progression of diseases and illness.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The great sociologist Ivan Illich prophesized in his book </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Medical Nemesis</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, \"the medical establishment has become a major threat to health.\" Skeptics refuse to acknowledge or even perceive the facts behind this claim and its long term consequences while America's infant mortality rate increases as the average life span declines. This is a system that relies more upon a barrage of manipulated science, biased and invalid trial results in medical journals, conflicts of interest, armies of Big Pharma lobbyists and false propaganda incubated within the federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services instead of honest, independent facts that best serve public welfare rather than the drug industry's coffers. Furthermore the corporate media has also assumed a role in fueling this culture of medical deception in order to protect one of its major revenue bases: Big Pharma. The US and New Zealand are the only two countries in the world that permit drug advertisements on television.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Skeptics base their aggression against alternative medicine with the false argument that positive clinical trial results are not reproducible. Consequently, there is \"plausibility\" to confirm that such therapies are ineffective and there is no rationale for continuing to pursue them, let alone fund further research. They also consistently argue that their opinions are settled facts based on scientific consensus. But the real facts show otherwise, notably in the trends noted above that alternative and natural practices are being increasingly accepted by conventional medical institutions. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/medical-students-say-western-medicine-150587\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">largest national survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> of its kind, researchers from UCLA and the University of California, San Diego, measured medical students’ attitudes and beliefs about CAM.  The survey found that 84 percent of medical students believe that conventional medicine would benefit from natural integrative and complementary beliefs, ideas and treatment modalities. Seventy-seven percent felt conventional physicians who learned other complementary medical disciplines would benefit their patients. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, in the opinion of Skeptics, these students are delusional and victims of magical thinking.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Careful readings of Skeptic diatribes, essays and opinion pieces may raise serious doubts about their authors' capacity for critical thinking skills.  During a talk at a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewOSMNgfGQ\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">National Capital Area Skeptics' gathering</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, when asked by an audience member why he defends genetically modified foods, David Gorski made the disingenuous reply that \"all foods are genetically modified\" -- a likely misleading reference to a belief in the now discredited \"substantial equivalence\" hypothesis coined by the agro-chemical industry in 1993 to argue that genetically engineered crops are no different than their natural counterpart. The FDA adopted this expression to make the assumption that since GMOs are essentially genetically the same as their conventional originals, there are no additional human health and safety concerns for consumption. It was also a strategy for the FDA not to require data to review GMO's safety on human health. Of course, during the past two decades, independent researchers, such as Dr. Gilles-Eric Seralini at France's University of Caens, continue to discover clear differences in nutrient ratios, yields and serious disease risks between GMOs and their organic counterparts.  Gradually, the verdict regarding the myth of GMO safety is being shown to have been based upon pseudoscientific arguments. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In recent years, we finding detractors from within the Skeptic movement coming forth to criticize institutionalized Skepticism's shortcomings.  For example, </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">PZ Myers, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, has held a reputation for being one of the more belligerent celebrities in the Skeptic movement.  Myers along with Skeptic Jerry Coyne and astrophysicist Sean Carroll were largely responsible for the censoring of biologist Rupert Sheldrake and alternative historian Graham Hancock from the TED talks.  However even the Skeptic movement has become too much for Myers. In his </span><a href=\"https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/05/05/i-officially-divorce-myself-from-the-skeptic-movement/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">public statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> on Free Thought Blogs to announce his resignation from the movement, he wrote, “it is clear that ‘scientific skepticism’ is simply a crippled buggered version of science with special exemptions to set certain subjects outside the bounds of its purview.”</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">“Skepticism has no sacred cows, “ writes Myers, “I was also annoyed by the skeptic movement’s appropriation of the term “scientific” all over the place… except that it’s a “science” that doesn’t make use of accumulated prior knowledge, that abandons the concept of the null hypothesis [the assumption that there is no relationship between variables in a population selected for statistical data collection], and that so narrowly defines what it will accept as evidence that it actively excludes huge domains of knowledge. It’s toothless science that fetishizes “consumer protection” over understanding.” </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Massimo Pigliucci, an evolutionary biologist and philosopher now teaching at City College of New York, is a former prominent Skeptic and columnist for the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Skeptical Inquirer</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> magazine. </span><a href=\"https://scientiasalon.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/reflections-on-the-skeptic-and-atheist-movements/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pigliucci too has withdrawn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> from the \"skeptic and atheist movements (SAM)\". He notes that the movement \"has become a somewhat inhospitable environment for philosophical dialogue.\"  It \"worships celebrities who are often intellectual dilettantes, or at the very least have a tendency to talk about things of which they manifestly know very little.\"  He also accuses the movement as being saturated with \"groupthink\" and narcissistic regard for its own intellectual stubbornness \"that is trumped only by religious fundamentalists.\"  Finally, Pigliucci identifies a fundamental problem that we too have encountered in Skeptic websites, blogs and notably Wikipedia, which is an atmosphere of \"public shaming and other vicious social networking practices any time someone says something that doesn't fit [their] own opinions all the while of course claiming to protect \"free speech\" at all costs.\"</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As we have detailed in many previous articles, Skeptics control many if not most Wikipedia entries for alternative medicine, natural health and the paranormal.  Most have no medical background nor experience in healthcare. One long time Wikipedia editor who was attempting to correct falsehoods and abusive language on the encyclopedia's pages for Drs. Deepak Chopra and Rupert Sheldrake, went head-to-head with senior Wikipedia editors before being banned.  On his blog \"Wikipedia We Have a Problem\" former editor Rome Viharo confirms Myer's and Pigliucci's charges against Skepticism's dogmatism and arrogance,</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"There is a disturbing pattern of behaviors evolving across Wikipedia – a number of skeptic activists on Wikipedia believe that only they are qualified to edit a large swath of topics and biographies on Wikipedia, and they seek to purge other editors from those articles or Wikipedia itself. Skeptic activists take this very seriously and treat Wikipedia like a battleground for their activism, where online harassment, slander, bullying, character assassination, and public shaming are all used as tactics to control editing permissions on the world’s largest repository of knowledge.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One of the hallmarks of supporting the credibility of scientific or medical information is to provide your curriculum vitae to show an author has an established level of scholarship and mastery in the field. Presumably, this can convince the reader that the author can differentiate accurate from false, biased from unbiased information. What delegitimizes Wikipedia from our regarding it as a reliable source is that Skeptic authors inevitably remain anonymous. In the majority of cases what limited biographical information they provide indicates they have no knowledge or firsthand experience in the medical profession. They are not credentialed. They have no board certifications or clinical background. Nor have they published in peer-reviewed journals. And with only rare exemptions do they have any knowledge or experience in CAM therapies.  Even a cursory examination reveals their heavy reliance upon grossly biased sources, more often than not found in Skeptic literature, magazines or Skeptical opinion blogs, with no scientific credibility and with malicious content. If we were simply dealing with one Skeptic editor, we could say this was an odd ball acting outside Wikipedia's editorial rules. However, we are dealing with a large group of anonymous Skeptics who have in unison collaborated to hijack the encyclopedia's alternative health pages to slander, lie, propagandize their creed and mislead the public by intentionally condemning many thousands of physicians, doctors, practitioners and researchers globally who are dedicated to proving the efficacy of these non-conventional medical systems and theories. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A censored society is an uneducated society</span><strong>.</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> It destroys progress and can even destroy careers, reputations and personal lives. This is a goal among Skeptics.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Nobel laureate Bertrand Russell, himself an outspoken skeptic of the pseudo-science during his day, observed a dangerous and darker trend to so called institutionalized if and when it were to become a tool for the State. Today, the federal health agencies -- the CDC and FDA as well as the USDA and EPA -- have merged and become inseparable from private or corporate interests. This has given rise to an edifice Russell called \"a scientific oligarchy.\" Scientific oligarchies, Russell warns, eventually become \"totalitarian.\" Oligarchies have the power and ability to control a narrative irrespective of how false and deceptive their message may be. We believe Skeptic groups such as Quackwatch, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, the Society for Science Based Medicine, Cornell Alliance for Science and others serve as the inquisitional foot soldiers to assure that \"all forms of power,\" in Russell's words, \"become a monopoly of the State.\"  These Skeptic groups, believing themselves to be the stalwarts of rational science, are part of the new dictatorial oligarchy that is willing to ban alternative medical practices that do not pass their personal litmus tests. </span><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=vEv7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=we+shall+create+paradise.+And+so+narcissistically+hypnotized+by+contemplation&source=bl&ots=2TAUf46B42&sig=ACfU3U0ooYnM9zfHTm4aokCwW0paKd2cEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi89arck6rmAhUSjVkKHR4TBnw\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We should heed Russell's warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> about the scientific elite, who continue to dominate and rule over the medical establishment despite the medical trends now reevaluating and accepting CAM therapies. Russell tells us that medical tyrants and bureaucrats will tell us, \"we are wise and good, we know what reforms the world needs; if we have the power, we shall create paradise. And so narcissistically hypnotized by contemplation of their own wisdom and goodness, they proceeded to create a new tyranny, more drastic than any previously known.\"  Skeptics don't hide their ambitions to be modern medicine's authoritative voice. Their faith in their own faux authority abhors our individual freedom to treat our bodies' illnesses as we feel fit. Skeptics loathe those who would challenge their authority and who would chastise their shortcomings, failures and blatant mishandling of scientific facts and evidence to conceal Skepticism's deficiencies and their own promulgation of pseudo-science hidden behind a veil of cherry-picked research that confirms their biased claims. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In 1954, the late great French sociologist, philosopher and Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul </span><a href=\"https://ratical.org/ratville/AoS/TheTechnologicalSociety.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">foresaw</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that every form of technology had the potential to turn into a form of control, power and a means to achieve efficiency for undemocratic causes. Today, this is clearly evident in the incumbency Wikipedia's co-founder and his Foundation has handed to modern Skepticism to redefine alternative medicine as a pseudoscience worth banishing to the dustbin of history. Yet this is all part of Skepticism's and Wikipedia's efforts to further manipulate and raise the public's uncertainty and confusion so there is no other place to turn to besides a collapsing, untrustworthy corporate medical system.  </span></p>",

This trend has been underway for several decades. This has been perceived as competition by the medical establishment. The reasons for this growing popularity includes the cost of conventional treatments, rising out-of-pocket expenses, serious drug adverse effects, and physician and diagnostic errors continue to plague the orthodox medical establishment. More than ever people are questioning whether conventional medical treatments are as safe and effective as promised.  </span><a href=\"https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult-populations#detailed/1/any/false/37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38/39,40,41/416,417\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">According to</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> the federal National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, approximately 83 million American adults (38%) used some type of CAM protocol or treatment in 2018, the most popular being supplements such as Omega-3, glucosamine, coenzyme Q-10, melatonin and botanical supplements such as ginseng, ginkgo, and Echinacea. </span><a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/news/camstats/costs/costdatafs.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In 2007</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, the National Health Interview Survey calculated there were approximately 354 million visits to CAM practitioners; today that figure is significantly higher as CAM enters mainstream medical practice and is gradually being covered by insurance companie.  </span><a href=\"https://www.brainblogger.com/2014/06/09/who-uses-complementary-and-alternative-medicine/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Outside of the US</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, surveys show CAM is more popular. In South Korea 75% of the population used a CAM treatment annually and 52% of Australians use CAM regularly. These healing modalities include acupuncture, Chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, the Chinese and Indian Ayurveda medical systems, orthomolecular and energy medicines, meditation and stress-reduction techniques, Chinese martial arts and yoga, nutritional counseling, and a wide range of massage and mind-body therapies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales claims to hold high standards of objectivity and balance in the content of the online encyclopedia and the integrity of his volunteer army of editors.  Indeed this is largely true for non-controversial content where economic, political, social factors hold no consequence. Yet, when it comes to the composition and editing of CAM systems and natural healthcare, in our opinion Wikipeida is an arsenal of misinformation and lies; we believe it has become a malignant growth to serve the ideological and financial purposes of select individuals and groups Wales has shown favor towards.  A group of individuals and organizations, collectively known as Skeptics, who assert they represent “science-based medicine” now portend to be the final arbiters of what is and is not sound medical practice. However, it is our opinion the Skeptics are grossly biased, widely uneducated about CAM, and are both anti-science and anti-health. Skeptics consistently refuse to accept the enormous volume of published CAM research because it is contrary to Skepticism's regressive understanding about medicine and limited to a pharmacological model.  </span></p>",

The internet war of words was the first instance revealing Wales' prejudiced disdain for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and a clear indication that he firmly embraces modern Skepticism's dogma and culture to destroy CAM therapies. Due to the misleading and incorrect information on Wikipedia's page for Energy Psychology, Dr. Vajda posted a petition on Change.org to put out a call for people to boycott giving donations to the encyclopedia. The petition stated:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"Wikipedia is widely used and trusted. Unfortunately, much of the information related to holistic approaches to healing is biased, misleading, out-of-date, or just plain wrong. For five years, repeated efforts to correct this misinformation have been blocked and the Wikipedia organization has not addressed these issues. As a result, people who are interested in the benefits of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Energy Medicine</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Energy Psychology</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, and specific approaches such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Emotional Freedom Techniques</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thought Field Therapy</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Tapas Acupressure Technique</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, turn to your pages, trust what they read, and do not pursue getting help from these approaches.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Vajda is simply restating a common complaint every professional association of a CAM discipline has voiced against Wikipedia. That is, we believe Wikipedia makes intentional efforts to dissuade the public from turning to CAM treatments to remedy their illnesses and disease. The only alternative Wikipedia offers patients, therefore, is conventional, pharmaceutical-based medicine. In effect, Wales and his WikiMedia Foundation are intentionally or unintentionally astroturfing on behalf of pharmaceutical economic interests. And the Foundation is by no means free from being financially entangled with drug makers. Over the years it has received donations from Amgen, Astex Pharma, Biogen, Bristol Myer, Merck, Pfizer and United Health. It has also received several million dollars from Alphabet (the parent company of Google), which is now a formal private pharmaceutical company partnering with Glaxo, Merck and Novartis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Vajda also singles out the Skeptics who have co-opted Wikpedia's pages and with intentional malice skew and reject the scientific data showing the efficacy and safety of these alternative medical modalities:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"Wikipedia pages for Energy Psychology, Energy Medicine, acupuncture and other forms of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM), [...] are currently skewed to a negative, unscientific view of these approaches despite numerous rigorous studies in recent years demonstrating their effectiveness. These pages are controlled by a few self-appointed “skeptics” who serve as de facto censors for Wikipedia. They clothe their objections in the language of the narrowest possible understanding of science in order to inhibit open discussion of innovation in health care. As gatekeepers for the status quo, they refuse discourse with leading edge research scientists and clinicians or, for that matter, anyone with a different point of view. Fair-minded referees should be given the responsibility of monitoring these important areas.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Wales angrily responded that \"</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What we won't do is pretend that the work of lunatic charlatans is the equivalent of true scientific discourse. It isn't.\"  In response Vajda provided 51 peer-reviewed articles and studies, 18 which were randomized controlled, appearing in professional journals, including the American Psychological Association, the Journal of Clinical Psychology, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases, Psychotherapy Theory Research and Practice and others showing positive statistical results outside the range of chance. In fact the volume of published scientific literature she could have provided is vastly larger.  Endorsements by major conventional medical associations, such as the American Psychological Association, the Association of Social Work Boards, the National Board of Certified Counselors, and  the National Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors were also cited to confirm Energy Psychology's acceptance and efficacy in mainstream medicine. Nevertheless every attempt made to correct the Skeptics' litany of misinformation and questionable citations were rejected.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Wales' discriminatory labeling of CAM practitioners as \"lunatic charlatans\" has been taken up by Wikipedia's Skeptic editors as a mantra to validate their hidden agendas. Frequently on editorial Talk pages, Skeptics quote Wales' words to convince their critics that he supports their cause. The term also gives Skeptics license to defame CAM supporters as quacks and a </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lunatic_charlatans\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">separate Wikipedia page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> for \"Lunatic Charlatans\" was created on the encyclopedia.  The page states in no uncertain terms Wikipedia's policy to discredit CAM and continue to identify it as pseudoscience:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"This unapologetic endorsement of the NPOV [neutral point of view] policy on pseudoscience and the policy on fringe science  is the clearest indication yet that Wikipedia's robust response to cranks, quacks and charlatans is solidly in line with Wikipedia's foundational goals.\" </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYAQ-ZZtEU\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">During a TEDx lecture</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, former CBS program host Sharyl Attkinsson described Wikipedia as \"astroturf's dream come true.\" It is no secret that pharmaceutical companies will hire public relations firms to recruit writers and publicists to infiltrate Wikipedia pages and edit positive messages about their drugs and products. They also join Talk groups to influence editorial discussions in favor of removing criticisms, regardless of how much scientific literature to the contrary. By definition, astroturfing is the practice of concealing the financial sources behind public messages in order to give the impression that reporting originates from unbiased and objective grassroots sources. However, astroturfing does not necessarily require manipulation of messaging for economic advantage as a fundamental motivation. It can also be ideological, for example, the psychological astroturfing waged by Skeptics, such as Susan Gerbic's and Tim Farley's Guerrilla Skeptics on Wikipedia, to promulgate what we interpret as blatant misinformation and even defamatory content to portray its opponents negatively. Wikipedia's Energy Psychology page is a clear example of Skeptics' ideological astroturfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Skeptics rely heavily upon the data provided by the astroturf organization Quackwatch.  Since 1980, Quackwatch's founder Stephen Barrett has served on the scientific advisory board of the American Council on Science and Health, a corporate front group that has been heavily criticized by the FDA and Public Citizen for providing false propaganda on products known to endanger human health and the environment, including tobacco, pesticides, BPA, genetically modified crops, junk food and high corn syrup soft drinks. Stephen Novella, founder of the Skeptic blog Science Based Medicine, likewise serves on the Council's advisory board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Quackwatch and the Science Based Medicine blog technically function as forums for ideological astroturfing. In the case of the former, there have been charges of financial and institutional conflicts of interest as well. Throughout many of their essays criticizing alternative medicine, Quackwatch and Science Based Medicine Skeptics take many of the Council's main talking points. In some cases, particularly when accusing alternative practices as financial scams, Quackwatch and the Council are indistinguishable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">On the Wikipedia page for Energy Medicine, the visitor is told,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"Energy medicine, energy therapy, energy healing, vibrational medicine, psychic healing, spiritual medicine or spiritual healing are branches of alternative medicine based on a pseudo-scientific belief that healers can channel healing energy into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods: hands-on, hands-off,  and distant (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations... While early reviews of the scientific literature on energy healing were equivocal and recommended further research, more recent reviews have concluded that there is no evidence supporting clinical efficiency. The theoretical basis of healing has been criticized as implausible, research and reviews supportive of energy medicine have been faulted for containing methodological flaws and selection bias and positive therapeutic results have been determined to result from known psychological mechanisms.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However the actual peer-reviewed challenge this assumption. Rich Umbdenstock, the President of the American Hospital Association, </span><a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/rehab/workfiles/urban%20zen/research%20articles/reiki_really_works-a_groundbreaking_scientific_study.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">has stated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, \"Complementary and alternative medicine has shown great promise in supporting and stimulated healing.

Skeptics conduct themselves in a fashion in direct violation of Wikipedia's own rules for </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">maintaining a \"neutral point of view\"</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (NPOV) which \"require a fair representation of all significant viewpoints regarding a subject.\" Both corporate and ideological astroturfing also prevail across Facebook and Google's search results that optimize pharmaceutical products' positive reviews. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Wikimedia Foundation and Wales have been fully aware of the culture of astroturfing that infects much of the encyclopedia's content. Given the very nature of Wikipedia's chaotic strategy to create an authentic encyclopedia by allowing anonymous writers and editors to create its content, astroturfing is inevitable. As the world's fifth most popular website, everyone who has a private agenda to push upon the public is welcome to participate. This is only further evidence that we believe Wikipedia should be a source of last resort for accessing any reliable information about non-conventional medical practices that are used by the majority of the world's population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In conclusion, we ask the members of the scientific and medical communities and in particular the media to do their due diligence before they rush to judgment to censure CAM therapies. We have done our homework. And we have identified thousands of peer-reviewed studies supporting the very therapies Wikipedia condemns, mocks and ridicules as pseudosicence or of no value. If Wikipedia Skeptics were criticizing only one or several modalities within CAM's enormous field of various medical and health systems, it would be reasonable. Rather they condemn CAM in its  entirety despite its long-standing scientific confirmation and history of success. Skeptics also deny the virtue of the most important and relevant part of the healing process: the relationship between the physician and patient in the clinical experience. Daily every medical doctor from surgeons to psychiatrists, from oncologists to pediatricians, from cardiologists to OGYN physicians ask their patients \"how do you feel\" in order to gain additional insights for continuing or to redirect the treatment. Therefore, we must consider the likelihood that the large majority of board-certified physicians and clinicians who have adopted CAM therapies began by relying solely upon the orthodox medical protocols they were educated in. At some point during their careers, they discovered these protocols' limitations and perhaps life-threatening risks. As a result, they searched outside the conventional paradigm for alternative and safer solutions to treat their patients. Today there is a growing number of doctors and patients using CAM because it works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What then does this say about the close-mindedness and rigid ideological beliefs of Wikipedia Skeptics who have neither the clinical experience as clinicians or as medical researchers?  Nevertheless the height Skeptics' hubris would deny the positive results millions of patients have received from CAM practitioners. We regard this the culture of cognitive dissonance as a  fundamental characteristic of modern day Skepticism. </span></p>",

It is a cogent, well-argued case for global rebellion—the only form of resistance that can save us from ecosystem collapse and human-induced genocide. It correctly analyzes the failure of environmentalist activists in groups such as 350.org to understand and confront global corporate power and thus make a meaningful impact as we barrel toward ecocide. “Common Sense for the 21st Century” is a survival manual for the human species. “The corrupt system is going to kill us all unless we rise up,” Hallam, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, bluntly warns. The activism, protests, lobbying, petitions, appeals to the United Nations and misguided trust in “liberal” politicians such as Barack Obama and Al Gore, along with the work of countless NGOs, have been accompanied by a 60% rise in global carbon dioxide emissions since 1990. The United Nations estimates this will be augmented by a 40% rise in CO2 emissions in the next 10 years. Hallam, who has long been a part of the environmental movement, says of his past activism: “I was wasting my time.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comment-share__social\"><a href=\"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/how-to-save-the-planet-and-ourselves/\"> Read More </a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
