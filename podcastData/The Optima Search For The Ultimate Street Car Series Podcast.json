    "description": "The bi-monthly show that details the latest and greatest in the Optima Search for the Ultimate Street Car Series! Hosted by race series director Jimi Day and automotive podcast veteran Rob Kibbe, this INSIDE SCOOP show will follow the drivers, news, and events that encompass the Optima Search for the Ultimate Street Car series. Fans of Adam Carolla's CarCast, NPR's Car Talk, the Autoblog Podcast, the Pro-Touring.com Podcast, and The MuscleCar Place Podcast will certainly enjoy this show. \n\nThe Optima Search For the Ultimate Street Car Series is the amateur competition series centered on drivers and REAL high performance street cars, where modern day Corvette's and Evo's compete alongside the best old-school Pro-Touring muscle cars around. Race cars with license plates need not apply! Each event features a design and engineering review, a road rally, an autocross, a speed-stop challenge, and a road course segment. Events are held all throughout the U.S. on exciting and historic race tracks like Laguna Seca, Sebring, and Daytona! \n\nDrivers are classified by experience, and rookies are just as welcome as veterans. All driving and racing fans (NASCAR fans, Indy Fans, and Formula 1) are welcome to attend or participate too! Be sure to follow our series on MavTV as well!",
