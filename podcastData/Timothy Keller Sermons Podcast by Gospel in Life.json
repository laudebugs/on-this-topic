            "description": "If you’re going to make it through life, you need something we hardly talk about today. It’s not identical to knowledge, and it’s not identical even to moral goodness. It’s wisdom. You’re going to make an absolute muck of your life if you don’t find and grow in wisdom. There’s no better place to go to than the book of Proverbs. As an introduction to the book, we’re looking at chapter 8, which as we go through it, we will see, shows us the importance of wisdom, the definition of wisdom, the problem of wisdom, and a clue to the solution. This sermon was preached by Rev. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 12, 2004. Series \"Proverbs: True Wisdom for Living\". Scripture: Proverbs 8:10-16; 22-31.

            "description": "We live in a culture where the psychology class will teach that your problem is a lack of self-esteem, but the philosophy and biology classes will teach you that you are nothing. The doctrine of creation shows that the universe is not an accident and that every single human being has inherent value because they are made in the image of God. Yet, God is not merely a distant creator. God entered the world and died to redeem it because He loves us so much. This sermon was preached by Rev. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 16, 2011. Series \"To Know the Living God; The Majesty of God\".

            "description": "In sixth century BC, Babylon was the preeminent power in the world, and this passage shows how they conquered Israel and deported the professional classes, including artisans, scholars, and government and military officers, in order to subjugate them through assimilation. This passage shows how Daniel and his three friends confronted the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar. What happened in that confrontation? This sermon teaches three things: the pressure of pluralism, the precision of truth faith, and the promises of suffering. This sermon was preached by Rev.

            "description": "Naturally we’re inclined to spend our money on ourselves and if we have any left over, we will give it to ministry and charity. However, Jesus shows us how our priorities need to change. Giving to ministry and charity must come first. Only then should we figure out how to spend the rest of our money. Yet, it is only through the Gospel that we can give so much away. It is only when we are spiritually rich that we can stop looking at money as our real wealth and security. It is only when we look forward to the resurrection that we can be assured that the sacrifices we’ve made in this life will pale in comparison to the joys awaiting us in the age to come.

            "description": "How does a Christian live as a believer in an unbelieving world? God calls His people to be spiritually bi-cultural. God does not want His people to either assimilate or segregate. He wants them to become part of the city, to pray for the city and seek its peace and prosperity. Yet, God also insists that His people retain their distinctiveness and not compromise their allegiance to Him. Christians are called to love the city of man for the sake of the city of God.

            "description": "If God was unipersonal, there would have been no love until he created the world. However, if the world was created by a triune God, then relationships of love are what life is all about. The Godhead is characterized by mutual self-giving love as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit orbit around one another in a dance. It is impossible for us to join in if we focus on ourselves, but through Jesus Christ and his sacrificial death on the cross, we can be brought into the dance. This sermon was preached by Rev.

            "description": "There are some churches that care about evangelism but not about serving the poor. Other churches will eagerly serve the poor but they don’t care about proclaiming the Gospel. But churches aren’t meant to do one or the other; they must do both. In fact, the two are linked. When non-Christians see Christians sacrificially serving the needy, it displays the beauty of God to them and becomes an aid to evangelism. Separately, serving the poor doesn’t just help others, but helps ourselves. One of the signs that we have truly experienced God’s love is that we can love others – in word and in deed.

Just as we come to know a person through speaking to them and listening to their words, we come to know God by listening to Jesus speak to us. Yet, Jesus did not come solely to speak. He came to live among us so that there is nothing we will suffer that He has not also suffered. But most of all, He came to die for us. In the incarnation, God became vulnerable to us - even to death - and yet He loved us so much that He was glad to so. This sermon was preached by Rev.

It runs all through the Bible, beginning with the story of Abraham being asked to kill Isaac, continuing with the Passover in Egypt, and running through the Passover supper with Jesus and his disciples. In all of these cases a lamb is offered as a sacrifice for a debt.  In John 1, John the Baptist tells us to \"behold the lamb of God,\" meaning to soak in and understand who Jesus is and the debt he paid for us with his death. This sermon was preached by Rev.

Freud claimed that religion is psychological self-justification, that we created God to assuage our guilt and fear. Marx claimed that religion is a sociological self-justification, that we created God to exclude those unlike us. Nietzsche said that religion is nothing but a power trip, an attempt to use God to accrue power over others. However, Jesus himself critiqued religion and turned it on its head.
