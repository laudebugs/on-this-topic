And that story includes creating a weighted blanket that will change the way you sleep.</p><p>After 15 years searching for fulfillment through her career—in politics, publishing, finance and start-ups, Elizabeth Grojean detached from life in the city to look within. She headed to Bali where she focused on meditation, yoga, healing and finding a new way of living—one rooted in connection, generosity and mindfulness.</p><p>On that foundation, she created the sleep and wellness company <a href=\"https://balooliving.com/dave\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Baloo Living</a> and launched a weighted blanket as her first product. It's a year-round self-care tool.</p><p>Studies show that pressure touch stimulates serotonin in the body. By using a weighted blanket, “it becomes faster and easier to go to sleep,” Elizabeth explains. “There's a very subtle but sudden physical, physiological response that happens. The pressure on the body is letting you know that it's safe to relax that fight or flight response.”</p><p>Within months of its 2018 launch, Baloo earned a reputation as one of the top brands on the market, where it remains. Elizabeth doesn’t compromise when it comes to materials or experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“The idea of doing something good for yourself by using a bag of plastic felt so negative to me in terms of the environmental aspect of that,” she says. “Energetically, I just didn't like the idea of that at all.” Instead, Baloo’s blankets use materials certified to be free of chemicals and toxins.</p><p>From tips on finding yourself, entrepreneurship and how to ease your anxiety and sleep better with a weighted blanket, you’re going to learn a lot in this episode from Elizabeth’s path.</p><p>Enjoy!

He is an acclaimed Qigong Master and Taoist Abbot with a practical approach to modern living.</p><p>In our unpredictable and continually changing world, we are constantly in a state of figuring out how to sow our seeds for a happy life, which necessitates tending to the needs of our health, career, family and friends, passions, and desires. Unfortunately, time never seems to be on our side, and if anything, often it seems out of our control.</p><p>But what if you had the ability to take control of how you trade your energy for time and to increase your body’s “energy budget?”</p><p>“Once you get your life lined and you figure out where you want your energy to go, it's like cash in the pocket,” Pedram says.&nbsp;“It doesn't hurt to have more once your economics are fixed, and that's where I think a lot of people lose it is their focus is everywhere so their life is everywhere, and they don't get the life that they say they want because they're just not focusing on their priorities. They're not focusing on their life.”</p><p>Your life circles around an exchange of time, money, and energy.</p><p>“In Chinese medicine we say the Qi follows the Shen, the spirit,” Pedram says. “Spirit is the attention housed in the heart. So where your focus goes, your energy goes, and if you can sustain your focus, the energy that you're generating through the cells of your body, through the mitochondria, through this miraculous thing called life, continues to go to where your focus goes, and then the material universe starts to assemble around that.”</p><p>&nbsp;Enjoy!

In her newest book, “<a href=\"http://www.harperwave.com/book/9780062862884/Good-Chemistry-Julie-Holland/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Good Chemistry: The Science of Connection, From Soul to Psychedelics</a>,” she explains why we need connection, how we’ve lost it, and how we might find it again. She believes psychedelics can help.</p><p>“We're really not built to be isolated,” Dr. Holland explains. “We're social primates, we're built for connection. It's how we survive.”</p><p>Dr. Holland stands on the frontlines of some of the nation’s leading and most exciting research surrounding psychedelic medicine and connection. “If we ever needed less suffering and more creativity, it is now. We need outside-the- box solutions to our current psychospiritual problems,” she says.</p><p>&nbsp;Psychedelic medicines, taken under the direction of a trained psychiatrist, can catalyze a connection with the self, nature, or the cosmos.</p><p>&nbsp;Dr. Holland reveals how we can “turn on” and “tune in” to the brain chemistry that supports connection and tamp down the fight or flight mode that derails sleep, metabolism, libido and much more. She helps us understand that our behaviors are driven by the hormones and neurotransmitters that make up good (and bad) brain chemistry, including; testosterone, estrogen, dopamine, serotonin and most crucially, oxytocin.</p><p>“The thing that we really haven't heard enough about and that I am sort of preaching is the parasympathetic nervous system,” Dr. Holland says. “It's the exact opposite of fight or flight. It's not all about attacking and running away. Sometimes survival is about staying and connecting and collaborating, getting input from people, making good decisions.”</p><p>“The parasympathetic is where the body can repair itself and it's also where we can repair our relationships,” she says. “It's where we can sort of tend and befriend and mend the connections, it's where we can be social.”</p><p>Listen on to the end to hear Dr. Holland’s top three recommendations for enhancing connection in your life.</p><p>Enjoy!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, Dr. Vivek Murthy and I talk about a topic that often doesn’t get talked about<strong>–</strong>loneliness. People often don’t know how to define it; they just know they feel it. Sometimes people are afraid to admit it. It also harms people’s health, productivity, and happiness.</p><p>I was intrigued by Dr. Vivek Murthy’s book “<a href=\"https://www.vivekmurthy.com/together-book\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World</a>.”</p><p>Dr. Murthy is an internal medicine physician who served as the 19th Surgeon General of the United States appointed by President Barack Obama. During his service, he visited communities all over the United States to find out what health issues concerned people most.&nbsp;</p><p>“To my surprise, the topic of emotional well-being, in general, and loneliness in particular, received the strongest response from the public of any issues I worked on as surgeon general,” Dr. Murthy says in his book. “It’s a universal condition that affects all of us directly or through the people we love.”</p><p>He also saw a common thread of loneliness when he took care of patients in private medical practice.</p><p>His work with loneliness obviously leads to the power of connection. Human connection is critical to our health, its value is often overlooked, and it couldn’t be more timely to talk about right now.</p><p>“During this global pandemic, people have actually been pulled even further apart in some ways,” Dr. Murthy says. “We're not able to see each other as readily as we were able to before. That has introduced an even deeper element of loneliness into many people's lives. My worry is that if we don't do anything differently, if we don't recognize what's happening, then we will experience a deepening of that loneliness and trigger something that I think of as a social recession.”</p><p>He also says that loneliness is a great masquerader: it can look like anger, boredom, depression or anxiety. There’s no shame in identifying loneliness for what it is, which is, in fact, a common human condition. And with awareness, we can name it and take steps to shore up our social connections. There are many tips in this episode to help you foster deeper connections and improve your well-being.</p><p>“If we harness the power of social connection and recognize just how much it could impact our health, our performance and our sense of fulfillment, then we could improve our lives in extraordinary ways,” Dr. Murthy says.</p><p>Enjoy!

In fact, friendship is as important as food and fitness.</p><p>Throughout human history, family and romantic relationships have gotten all the attention. Friendships weren’t even considered essential. That’s all changing now as scientific study digs into the biological, psychological, and emotional effects of friendship. Scientists can now define and measure it. And they are finding that friendship quality matters much more than quantity–sorry, not sorry, social media.</p><p>“The biological part of it is that we now understand that friendship is as important for your health as diet and exercise,” Lydia says.&nbsp;</p><p>“And it gets under your skin as scientists say. It really affects your health on all kinds of levels: your immune system, your stress, your cardiovascular system, your mental health and cognitive health,” Lydia says. “And the fact that it does that<strong>–</strong>that a relationship that exists outside the body entirely can get in and change how your health works<strong>–</strong>seems&nbsp;to me a sign that this is something that is really critical and that is deserving a far more respect and attention than we tend to give it.”</p><p>Lydia is&nbsp;an acclaimed science journalist&nbsp;and&nbsp;contributing editor at Scientific American where she&nbsp;covers the brain and psychology. She’s&nbsp;visited brain imaging labs and baboon troops in Kenya and written about everything from Alzheimer’s to zebrafish. She’s been in a unique position to see the evolving science on friendship in the animal and human world.</p><p>“We now understand that there are real evolutionary advantages to being good at making and maintaining friends,” Lydia says.</p><p>Enjoy!

His work has been inspired by the notion that Alzheimer's as it is currently known is \"not just preventable, but reversible.\"&nbsp;</p><p>He’s currently the Chief Science Officer (CSO) of Apollo Health and a professor at UCLA. Dr. Bredesen was on the show on episode #522 where we talked about his&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestseller” “The End of Alzheimer’s.”&nbsp;</p><p>He’s back on the show with a detailed program that he uses with his own patients. This program can be tailored to anyone’s needs and will enhance cognitive ability at any age.</p><p>What we call Alzheimer’s disease is actually a protective response to a wide variety of insults to the brain: inflammation, insulin resistance, toxins, infections, and inadequate levels of nutrients, hormones, and growth factors.</p><p>“I really believe that this field&nbsp;[neurodegenerative diseases]&nbsp;has more misunderstandings, misconceptions, and misperceptions, and myths than just about any other field, and people are dying,” Dr. Bredesen says. “These are not just white lies. These are things that people are dying for, and so let's quit thinking that the brain is functioning as a linear system here, and let's look at what actually makes a difference for people's cognition.”</p><p>Dr. Bredesen’s “The End of Alzheimer’s Program” goes deeper into the science of reversing Alzheimer’s disease, with new research and a more programmatic approach that answers questions readers had after reading “The End of Alzheimer’s.” It lays out the tests, treatments and lifestyle musts you can do right now.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll take a dive into Ketoflex 12/3; get advice to prevent and reverse cognitive decline that is tailored to specific symptoms; learn more information about lifestyle influences; and examine the risks and solutions for toxic exposure.</p><p>In this conversation, Dr. Bredesen also recommends starting with the big three: a series of blood tests, a cognitive assessment, and an MRI with volumetrics.

Most of the foods that we're eating are acidic. The dental products that were being sold on the market are creating more acids in your mouth. The more acid you have in your mouth, the more minerals your teeth lose, the more bad bacteria you grow, and the more chance of having what I call leaky gum syndrome or gingivitis.

You may not even realize how much it’s affecting your career or your personal relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we’re going to biohack your voice! I’ve invited Roger Love on the show because he’s one of the world’s leading authorities on vocal sound. I’ve been working with him myself and have learned so much about how I breathe and how my nervous system works.&nbsp;</p><p>“Singing and speaking is basically the exact same thing,” Roger says. “When you sing, you have control over pitch, how high or how low you go, pace, how fast or how slow you go. Melody: does it go up like this or does it go down like this? Volume and tone matter. Singers and speakers actually have the same ingredients like great chefs have. It's about how you mix those ingredients.”</p><p>In his 30 years of voice coaching experience, he’s trained over 130,000 people worldwide, including professional speakers, singers and actors (many who’ve won Grammy and Oscar awards) and professional communicators. Roger has won awards in film coaching credits, most recently for “A Star Is Born” featuring actor. Bradley Cooper, who sang all the songs himself, and Lady Gaga.</p><p>Roger combines scientific research with innovative techniques to go beyond simply word-smithing to help people create their own unique “sound” and find their voice.&nbsp;</p><p>He goes on to explain that “speaking is actually physically connecting with people because it’s vibrating your body,” Roger says. “If the sounds hit you, they vibrate your body. So those sounds go into the first part of the brain that's called the amygdala. And the job of the amygdala is to only let things through to the prefrontal cortex if it's emotional.”</p><p>If you make sounds where the melodies, volumes and tonal qualities are emotional, then the amygdala sends it right to the prefrontal cortex, where it gets processed, thought about, felt about and stored into memory and then the person can take action on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Super cool to know how our bodies and brains work together to make sense of vocal sounds!</p><p>And this matters for you now more than ever, because you spend all day every day, if you work from home, using your voice, in fact, your voice becomes much more important than the grainy video from your webcam most likely. This episode is full of great tips you can start using right away.</p><p>Enjoy!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, you’re going to learn how to breathe. And the person who’s going to explain it is my guest James Nestor. He’s a San Francisco-based science journalist, author, surfer, free diver, adventurer, and speaker. His new book, \"<a href=\"https://www.mrjamesnestor.com/breath-book\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</a>,” takes on a topic that we all take for granted.</p><p>So why is the topic of breathing so fascinating? Apparently, as “natural as breathing” really isn’t. Our breathing has evolved, and not for the better. Even though we think we know how to do it, our lives since the Industrial Age have been disrupted in ways that now are harming us.&nbsp;</p><p>James set out on a decade-long quest to find out where our breathing went wrong—and how to fix it.&nbsp;He uncovered the history of ancient breathing techniques and the science behind breathing.&nbsp;His book draws on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology. He takes an intense and interesting look at this basic biological function of ours.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the astounding things he discovered had to do with mouth breathing.&nbsp;</p><p>“Twenty-five to 50 percent of the population are chronic mouth breathers,” James says. “So, we don't use our noses either because we can’t, because they're always plugged up, or we just choose not to. …&nbsp;So&nbsp;many people have chronic sinus. So many people are mouth breathing. And so many people have asthma that we've accepted this as completely normal, and it's not. And the science is very clear what damage this is doing to us as a population.”</p><p>You’ll be thrilled at the stuff you’ll learn in this episode that you didn’t know before. From bone structure to oxygen intake to heart rate–and even your genitalia–breathing is at the center of it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>James is here to talk about ways that proper breathing can help heal modern medical conditions, ease anxiety and basically change your life.</p><p>Enjoy!

Some are considering or have been forced to make career changes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, my guest gives readers a candid behind-the-scenes look at what it’s really like to build a creative career.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Jeff Madoff says making a living with your ideas is a marathon not a sprint. In his brand new book, “<a href=\"https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/b-jeffrey-madoff/creative-careers/9780738246710/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Careers: Making a Living with Your Ideas</a>,” he draws on his own decades of experience and also the experience of more than 40 leading entrepreneurs, artists, and business leaders to give you an accessible path that will lead to success in whatever new career field you choose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Every entrepreneur that starts a business is creating something out of nothing, that's creativity,” Jeff says. “I define creativity as the compelling need to bring about change.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jeff Madoff began his career as a fashion designer and was chosen one of the top 10 designers in the U.S. He then switched careers to be a director, photographer and writer.</p><p><br></p><p>He founded Madoff Productions, a film production company that creates award-winning branded content including commercials, web content, music videos, and documentaries. His articles have appeared online in the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em>,&nbsp;<em>USA Today</em>,&nbsp;<em>Newsweek</em>,&nbsp;<em>Huffington Post</em>&nbsp;and other major publications. He’s since expanded his career to include teaching, book and playwriting, and theatrical producing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don't say no to yourself,” Jeff says. “Don't disqualify yourself by thinking you're not good enough, your idea doesn't have enough value, all those kinds of things. And then you don't do anything. Because a sure way to make sure nothing happens is to do nothing. So, there's a risk involved in even starting. And a lot of people are afraid to make that leap because of doubt. And they're afraid of taking that risk and not succeeding.”</p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy!

This year, I’ve been bringing you guests to help you get through challenging times for personal and economic wellness. Many employees, business owners and even entrepreneurs are concerned and anxious about the future state of their businesses, careers, and families.&nbsp;</p><p>Uncertainty drives fear and fear makes it harder to think. So,&nbsp;I'm bringing people in to say, hey, here's some tools, some facts, some knowledge to help you turn off the fear. My guest today, Kevin Harrington, has a way to make sure your personal and professional lives not only do well but thrive during this uncertainty and stress. He says is as simple as finding a mentor.</p><p>“One of the challenges entrepreneurs have is they're afraid to do it,” Kevin says. “They don't know what to say or where to go. Sometimes you just have to raise your hand and just go for it.&nbsp;Absolutely. And the universe has a way of bringing things back to the people that do need them, but you can't just sit.”</p><p>“And when COVID first hit, a lot of people were burying their heads in the sand. That's the time that you have to get out and start connecting. Connect and collaborate and do some things together because at times of strife like that, it's important not to give up&nbsp;but to see if there's opportunities and what problems can you solve right now.&nbsp;Mentors focus on problems and solutions.”</p><p>Kevin goes into detail on how mentors can benefit your professional growth in his new book, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mentor-Millions-Secrets-Business-Relationships/dp/1401959105/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mentor to Millions: Secrets of Success in Business, Relationships, and Beyond</a>.”</p><p>Kevin’s the original “shark” on the hit TV show Shark Tank, the creator of the infomercial, pioneer of the “As Seen on TV brand,” and co-founding board member of the Entrepreneur’s Organization. His work behind the scenes of business ventures has produced more than $5 billion in global sales, the launch of more than 500 products, and the making of dozens of millionaires. He’s launched massively successful products like The Food Saver, Ginsu Knives, The Great Wok of China, The Flying Lure, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>He's been called the Entrepreneur’s Entrepreneur and the Entrepreneur Answer Man, because he knows the challenges unique to start-ups and has a special passion for helping entrepreneurs succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy!

A cool invention called BioCharger™&nbsp;incorporates all four of these beneficial energies into one subtle energy revitalization platform called a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://biocharger.com/about-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SERP</a>. It has turned all this energy into a human recharging station.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll learn how the BioCharger™, a small device about 3 feet high and 2 feet wide, can positively affect your physical and mental performance, and your general health.</p><p>People experience significant gains in energy, recovery, performance, focus, sleep and flexibility.</p><p>Jim Girard, BioCharger™&nbsp;Inventor, brings more than 30 years of subtle energy research and development experience to the conversation.</p><p>“If you really think about it, everything vibrates,” Jim G. says. “Atoms literally vibrate at the speed of light. When you excite various gases or elements to fluorescent, they'll release photons of light. Molecules literally vibrate slightly lower than the visible light. When you take elements or atoms and start to mix them together and make molecules, they begin to vibrate what they call the molecular spectrum. Then you have your atomic nuclei that also vibrate. The cell membrane literally is vibrating.”</p><p>“Our body regenerates at 2 to 3 million new cells a second,” further explains Jim Law, BioCharger™&nbsp;CEO. “That's the only way it knows how to heal, how to recover, how to resist stress, and how to detoxify. But voltage is key. Voltage is the driver. Forty-five percent of Americans that have some form of chronic disease all have one common characteristic—and that's inadequate cellular voltage.”</p><p>The BioCharger™&nbsp;can help improve that voltage and also target specific areas of concern with individualized energy recipes. It can help you feel better, be more creative, and put you in a better mood. The BioCharger™&nbsp;is designed for personal, family or business use.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve been wanting a tech geek-fest, this is the episode for you. We dive right into the past 100 years of science influenced by Nikola Tesla, his protégés and his peers. “I believe Tesla was one of the most brilliant minds ever, and we have yet to really hit the surface of what he was actually doing,” says Jim G., who has closely studied Tesla’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It was so cool to find out how the discoveries of the past century are still relevant and moving our energy forward today.</p><p>Enjoy!

It's hard and I don't know how long this tunnel is, I don't know how long we're going to be in this tunnel, but I see a light at the end and I know we're going to get there and we just have to keep marching forwards together and we may even be stronger when we come out of it.\"</p><p>Simon has set his sights on advancing a vision of the world&nbsp;<em>that does not yet exist…&nbsp;</em>A<em>&nbsp;</em>world in which the vast majority of people wake up every single morning inspired, feel safe wherever they are, and end the day fulfilled by the work that they do.</p><p>He started with why and then asked people to find their why. He believes leaders need to eat last and together is better.&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he’s looking at the finite and infinite games being played out in all areas of life.</p><p>“One of the aspects of a finite mindset versus an infinite mindset is a finite mindset clearly wants to win, says Simon. “Except what happens if the game has no finish line and if you play to win in a game that has no finish line, you destroy trust, cooperation and innovation? One of the characteristics of a finite mindset is they are afraid of surprises and afraid of uncertainty.”</p><p>And that can be a detriment. Especially now. Where you just can’t do what you used to do in the same way.&nbsp;</p><p>“Crisis is the great revealer, right?” he says. “In an instant [during the world-wide pandemic], we discovered which companies had strong cultures and which company had weak cultures.”</p><p>“Somebody asked me recently, how has leadership changed during these times?” says Simon. “And the answer is,&nbsp;<strong><em>it hasn't</em></strong>. This is an amazing opportunity. All the tenets of good leadership are more important now than ever. So, think of others and look after others, especially the people you know. Take care of yourself and take care of each other is really what it's all about.”</p><p>“That's called good leadership. We don't need a global pandemic for you to do that. You should be doing that all the time.”</p><p>Simon also gives one of the Top 10 pieces of advice from experts in more than 700 episodes of this show. You’ll have to listen on to find out what it is.&nbsp;You’re going to get a lot out of today’s episode, as Simon talks to us about how to build better leaders, teams and companies in times of great change.</p><p>Enjoy!

The monk mind is of compassion, love, non-judgment, kindness. I feel like that's what so many of the people we know are striving for and aspiring for.

Then he pivoted to become a lawyer, then changed direction again to become an award-winning law professor, author, and public speaker.</p><p>The whole time, he kept on thinking like a rocket scientist. Here’s Ozan’s perspective on a few of the things we talked about:</p><p><strong>Figure Things Out:</strong>&nbsp;“In the real world, problems are not handed to you on a silver platter. You have to find the problem and then you have to reframe it. Define it. Figure out ways of looking at it from different angles so you can illuminate other answers that you may have initially missed, but you don't learn any of that in school.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pivot &amp; Problem-solving:</strong>&nbsp;“If you're listening to this and the pandemic has disrupted the way that you conduct your business, ask yourself, how do I solve the problems that the world needs solving right now, as opposed to the problems that I want it to solve, as opposed to the problems that I expected to solve? How can I use my skills, resources, product services in a way that I haven't used them before to address the problems that now exist in the world?</p><p><strong>Think Long Term:</strong>&nbsp;“Step No. 1 is just realizing that if you are able to look toward the long term, and stop chasing short-term outcomes, the results tend to be much better at a both personal institutional level.”</p><p><strong>Know Your Blind Spots:</strong>&nbsp;“Sometimes blind spots come because I am too close to the problem to think differently. And this happens quite a bit. You're so immersed in the weeds of what you’re talking about or what you’re thinking about. And it’s hard for you to step back and see other paths.”</p><p><strong>Find Your Curiosity:</strong>&nbsp;“Whenever I follow my natural curiosity, regardless of where it may be lead, that works out well for me. But when I start chasing outcomes, that completely robs the joy away from the process. Whenever I can turn process into play, work becomes play, play is work. There's really no distinguishing between the two, and I'm just following my curiosity, regardless of where it might lead. That's right where the magic happens.”&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio,&nbsp;my guest, Chloe Weber, L.Ac, MSOM,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a licensed&nbsp;acupuncturist and herbalist who’s also co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://radicalrootsherbs.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Radical Roots Herbs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>She’s on a mission to expand the reach of Chinese herbology and bring ancient healing into the modern world.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll learn a lot in this episode, I know I did! Chloe has taken what has been known to work over thousands of years of Chinese Medicine practice and adapted traditional formulas to conditions people are experiencing today.</p><p>“In Chinese medicine, instead of having a one-to-one correlation between a symptom and a cure, we're looking at the dynamic interplay of the body,” Chloe says. “So, we look at the body as a microcosm of the macrocosm. Everything that we see in nature, we use to describe the actions in what's going on in the body.”</p><p>“The same as with herbs,” she continues. “We’re really looking at the whole plant and how it’s inter-playing with the body. And then, instead of just doing one herb, we’re using different herbs together to create a formula so that we cannot only address the branch, which are the symptoms, but we can address the root, so we can really get to the underlying health issues.”</p><p>Chloe developed an interest in public health and medicine after being diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis as a teen. Her background in Ecology and Evolutionary biology in college led her to understand how diseases evolve and the deep connection between humans and our environment.&nbsp;She was drawn to Chinese medicine as a way to address public health issues.</p><p>She earned a Master of Science in Oriental Medicine and also studied at Heilongjiang University Hospital in Harbin, China. Chloe co-founded a non-profit, sliding-scale, walk-in Chinese herb clinic in Denver, eventually transitioning into private practice. There, she developed a deep interest in functional medicine and co-founded Radical Roots.&nbsp;</p><p>Her work with patients has had striking commonalities.&nbsp;</p><p>“One thing that's interesting and that I love about Chinese medicine because, as a clinician and as a human, I've seen a lot that the gut is really the foundation of health,” Chloe says. “It's the school of thought that basically says that digestion is the root of all illness and the root of all health and vitality.”</p><p>She’s also leaned on Chinese herbs to address her son’s health, while extensively studying integrative neurology. Now 6, Remy was diagnosed at age two-and-a-half with a one-in-20-million genetic disorder called STXBP1. “You definitely know you're in a shitshow if your child has a one in 20 million genetic disorder named after the gene that's mutated,” Chloe says. “We've had to go really outside of the box when it comes to treating him.”</p><p>Herb use in Chinese Medicine is an ancient and diverse way of healing.

And that's the world where I'd like to live in. That's how we lift our society up. That's how we stop making the same cyclical mistakes that each generation has to figure out. So, I'm excited by that vision!&nbsp;</p><p>“We are talking about disruption,” Jim says. “We're talking about execution. We're talking about future areas of opportunity.&nbsp;I would say that none of us know where it's going to end up in 10 years, but we do know that it's going to be radically different. Curiosity is a major component of success. You have to keep on seeking out and not discounting things just because they seem a bit radical.”</p><p>Jim’s known for his ability to recognize emerging trends that turn into new industries or major shifts in markets. This includes the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, new science and technologies, and now the field of aging research and longevity.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s working with biotech and life sciences companies that are looking at the&nbsp;<em>mechanisms</em>&nbsp;of aging. Currently underway are an FDA-approved migraine solution; a ketone ester; organ regeneration; and new drug applications.</p><p>There are five things that kill 70% of the 140,000 people that die every day on the planet (excluding COVID-19): stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's, obesity, and respiratory disease. “Those diseases, which are diseases of aging, are being addressed,” Jim says.</p><p>The research and product and clinical trials are moving at warp speed with the help of AI. So many people still believe that it’s not possible to influence the aging process, Jim says, but there’s incredible potential in this industry.</p><p>There’s also great potential in cellular agriculture to help solve how we’ll feed the billions of people on our planet. “There's a very high level of purity and all sorts of environmental positives to it,” Jim says, “but it's sort of at a very early stage.”</p><p>Listen on to learn more about the developments in longevity and sustainable food solutions that are changing our world right now.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

He treats patients who become too toxic and sensitive, and don’t tolerate usual medical treatments.</p><p>“It's currently thought that there are 10 million people in this country who have some degree of mold toxicity,” Dr. Nathan says. “So, we're not talking about a rare condition that no one would have any connection to whatsoever. It's common. And it comes from moldy buildings, which are ubiquitous in this country.”</p><p>“Mold symptoms are all over the place,” he says, “because mold toxicity affects inflammation in the body. And every area of the body can be inflamed by mold toxicity.”</p><p>There’s a basic biology to all mold dysfunction, explains Dr. Nathan. “Mold toxin enters the cells and begins to interfere with certain types of metabolism. That type of interference affects all parts of the body, including the brain and brain chemistry.”</p><p>Dr. Nathan has been practicing medicine for close to 50 years. He’s board certified in Family Practice and Pain Management and currently has a medical practice in Northern California. He has been working to bring an awareness that mold toxicity is a major contributing factor for patients with chronic illness.</p><p>In our conversation, we talk about mold’s effect on people, what doctors are getting wrong, and promising new treatments.</p><p>“Mold toxicity is something we can diagnose, and we can treat,” Dr. Nathan says. “So if you have yourself, a loved one, a friend, a neighbor, and they're suffering with a host of conditions and their doctors are scratching their heads and they don't know what they can do about it—the implication being it's in your head, but it's not—tell them about mold toxicity, because it is common and it's curable.”</p><p>Enjoy the show!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, we’re putting the spotlight on kava. It’s&nbsp;a powerful plant-based stress relieving, nootropic drink from islands in the South Pacific that boosts mood, enhances cognitive abilities and relieves anxiety.My guest is Cameron George, a researcher, writer, entrepreneur and the founder of TRU KAVA.</p><p>His profoundly&nbsp;personal experience with kava compelled him to research and develop products that could help others. He credits the kava with saving his life. “My story was definitely one of those what I call a pain-to-purpose journey,” Cameron says, “meaning that a lot of these discoveries that I made and even a lot of the other stuff that I'm involved in now&nbsp;all came out of my own pain.”</p><p>TRU KAVA is setting the industry standard for quality, safety and education around kava within the mass market.&nbsp;“There are more than 200 strains of kava that are used regularly in Vanuatu and Fiji mainly, and then other islands, as well,” Cameron explains. “Just like the world of cannabis, there are all these different strains. … Noble kava is kava that has to meet a certain chemical composition standard.”</p><p>Kava has been highly regarded for 3,000 years as a safe, natural alternative to drugs and alcohol. The effects are comparable to alcohol, without the drunkenness. The experience often is described as a calm, enhanced state of natural sobriety. Kava is completely non-addictive.</p><p>Kava also is commonly known as “the great protector” because it is one of nature’s most profound and complete protective substances. This means that when humans consume kava, it helps both protect the body from all forms of stress (physical, chemical, emotional) and rid the body of built-up stress.</p><p>Cameron says from its signature and its life force, Kava is a protective substance. “That's why it has... protective pathways from reducing glutamate levels through GABA and sodium calcium channel blocking to activating cellular autophagy and turning over fat into ketones. All of these things are protective, and the same thing with COX stuff and everything and the NRF2 upregulation, as well, that occurs. These are hormetic stress pathways.”</p><p>In the islands, kava is also known as a very gentle entheogen (psychedelic) that brings about creative and introspective thinking and makes users more empathetic.</p><p>“The entourage effect that we hear about in these plant medicines comes from the fact that a plant medicine or a fungal medicine is a living system,” Cameron says. “It's a living, intelligent system just like the human body is a living, intelligent system. It has a multitude of different active compounds in it that work synergistically. They're biologically compatible because they come from our natural ecology.”</p><p>Enjoy the show!

They could be the past. They can be in the present or the future, but if we're not conscious of where they are, then they're generally in the past or the future. So by focusing on that breath, focusing on the feeling of soothing touch, it instantly brings us back into our bodies, which helps us center us firmly in the present, which is literally the place where we have the most control of what's going on in our lives.”</p><p>He’s been studying the impact of trauma and chronic stress in humans for more than a decade and has some ideas on how you can manage it. In our conversation, we look at new ways that psychedelics are being combined with psychotherapy.</p><p>“Psychedelic medicine is unique because it allows us, whether it's MDMA or LSD, or psilocybin or ketamine, to step outside of that default mode and look back at ourselves, and really reappraise what it means to be us,” he says.</p><p>Dr. Rabin’s a neuroscientist, board-certified psychiatrist, health tech entrepreneur, inventor and researcher.

It opens up the pathways physically for the body to actually send the blood and raw materials and resources to help you heal, and it optimizes function in a way that just improves the overall recovery process.”</p><p>Science, research and functional neurology provide the backbone for NeuFit®. Garrett evolved his unique electrical stimulation protocols over the past decade and now helps athletes of all levels, as well as people recovering from spinal cord injury, stroke, and MS.</p><p>He and his team work directly with MLB, NHL, NBA, and NFL teams; major NCAA universities; hospital systems; physical therapy and chiropractic clinics; and fitness facilities.</p><p>&nbsp;Listen on to find out how to recover faster from injuries, reverse chronic pain, and experience big improvements in fitness and performance.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

For anyone experiencing hair thinning or loss, this episode covers all the latest hair science—what works, what’s new and what you can realistically expect—for both men and women.&nbsp;</p><p>My guest, Alan J. Bauman, M.D., is the founder, CEO and medical director of the medical hair loss practice he started 23 years ago.&nbsp;He’s a board-certified hair restoration physician and hair transplant surgeon who has treated more than 30,000 patients and performed more than 9,000 hair transplant procedures.&nbsp;He’s one of approximately only 200 physicians worldwide to achieve&nbsp;certification&nbsp;from the American and International Board of Hair Restoration Surgery.</p><p>This episode is airing during&nbsp;<strong>National Hair Loss Awareness Month</strong>&nbsp;in August to bring you all the latest science and technologies that are available. A lot of you are dealing with this problem. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 1 in 2 men in the U.S. will experience hair loss in their lifetime and 50 million will be affected by male-pattern baldness. Woman are affected, too. 1 in 4 women suffer from hair loss and thinning hair and 30 million women are affected by hair loss.*</p><p>Dr. Bauman’s been extensively featured in media worldwide as an&nbsp;elite medical hair loss&nbsp;expert for pioneering numerous technologies in the field of hair restoration. I traveled to Bauman Medical, a “hair hospital” in Boca Raton, Florida, before the pandemic lockdowns began in the U.S. to find out more about his treatments and how they worked.</p><p><strong>Scalp Health</strong>: Why it’s important and what it says about what’s going on in your body.</p><p>“Scalp health is a big problem,” says Dr. Bauman, “and we know now that there's a direct link between scalp health and the inflammation (in the body) that's going on. The hair fiber is dead but the follicle is alive, and when there's inflammation going on in and around that area the follicle just doesn't perform as well. So, scalp health is really important.”</p><p><strong>Hair Loss and Hair Thinning</strong>: It’s super common for both men and women! How to get the right diagnosis, evaluation and treatment options for the hair on your head, eyebrows and even beards.</p><p><strong>Topicals</strong>: What works and how to keep your scalp healthy along the way.</p><p>“There's now skin microbiome – microbiome of the scalp,” says. Dr. Bauman. “It's a new frontier of hair health that we're just starting to learn about.”</p><p><strong>Non-Surgical Hair Replacement Options</strong>: How lasers can optimize hair follicles.</p><p>“Low-level laser light therapy is a great technology, non-chemical, non-invasive way to impart energy to the hair follicles,” Dr. Bauman says. “We've progressed over 15 or 20 years from small hand-held devices, to little bands, to laser caps, and certainly now the devices are a lot more sophisticated, a lot more portable, and a lot more powerful, too.”</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Hair Transplants</strong>: Debunking the myths and misconceptions, so you can find out if you’re a candidate.</p><p>Bye, bye painful “plugs.” Comfortable, sophisticated, artistically-performed procedures can be undetectably natural with minimal downtime.</p><p><strong>Hair Regeneration</strong>: Stem cells and platelet-rich plasma are game-changers.</p><p>“We've leveraged platelet-rich plasma treatments, and the growth factors that they provide, for better hair regrowth,” Dr. Bauman says. Mesenchymal stem cells can be harvested and used for hair regrowth, too.</p><p><strong>3D-Printed Hair &amp; Scalp Prosthetics</strong>: The possibilities are life-changing for many.</p><p>“Hair restoration has changed so much just within the past five or 10 years&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;</strong>going from such an invasive process to something minimally invasive,” Dr. Bauman says.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, stress takes center stage.&nbsp;All of us are experiencing stress to some degree. From small stressors like life’s petty annoyances to big stressors like a pandemic, financial uncertainty and unrest in our communities.</p><p>Stress can embed itself in our bodies and minds, and really mess us up. That’s why I wanted to have Siim Land back on the show. He’s researched the science behind stress and how to hack it in his new book:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stronger-Stress-Beneficial-Stressors-Strengthen/dp/B08DD3LBNX/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" target=\"_blank\">Stronger By Stress: Adapt to Beneficial Stressors to Improve Your Health and Strengthen the Body</a>.</p><p>Siim is an author and speaker from Estonia who helps people improve their health and performance with biohacks. The first time he was on the show, we went all in on metabolic autophagy and intermittent fasting. I wanted to have him back on the show to talk about how to leverage stress adaptation for increased resilience and longevity.&nbsp;</p><p>“You need some small amounts of stress for the body to adapt to it, and especially the mitochondria to also become stronger from the stress,” Siim says. “Mitohormesis describes that where the mitochondria are just adapting to distress in a hormetic dose, like too much is bad, but too little is also bad. So, the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle.”</p><p>You can’t have physical stress adaptations without an accompanying mindset.&nbsp;</p><p>“Mindset is the very foundational aspect to being able to adapt to stress,” Siim says. “Because if you create this fear around stress, like hysteria and panic about stress, then you're never going to do some of those things that may be beneficial for you as well. You need to have some small amount of discomfort in your life in order to maintain a beneficial hormetic adaptation.”</p><p>You’re going to learn how to recognize stress, identify what it’s doing to your body and mind, and then apply skills to manage and adapt to it.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

Her authenticity is a rarity in a business where trends come and go within a matter of months. She’s an innovative mover who embraces change and seeks adventure. Her insatiable curiosity feeds her energy and vibrant outlook.</p><p>“It's a Buddhist philosophy of always looking at things with young eyes, fresh eyes, like you've never seen it before,” she says. “Where you get up and you're very present, you're very right now, you're very much like, ‘teach me something,’ as opposed to, ‘oh, I know that.’”</p><p>She believes that staying strong is the key to staying young and progress<strong>–</strong>not perfection<strong>–</strong>is a balanced approach.&nbsp;</p><p>“What's kept me in the game for all these years is that I have known when do you go hard and when do you back off and go gentle and do your yoga and your recovery and let your body heal,” Kathy says.</p><p>\"Think about your fitness,” she continues, “it’s cardio, it’s strength and it’s stretching mind-body balance. So, those three things interestingly enough have not changed that much through the years. What's changed is how we approach that.”</p><p>Kathy’s mastered fitness efficiency: prioritizing HIIT, hacking strength training with blood flow restriction, and experiencing the remarkable physical and mental benefits of nasal breathing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She’s also built a life and a lifelong business by connecting body and mind—and living that truth every day. She’s going to inspire you to do the same.</p><p>“At one point, we all have to look at our lives and just see how we're living them,” Kathy says. “If you honestly don't have enough time to take care of yourself and put yourself on your to-do list at all, then maybe it's time to evaluate the life a little bit.”</p><p>&nbsp;Enjoy the show!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, we’re talking about muscle, protein and the benefits of meat with a doctor who focuses on Muscle-Centric-Medicine™. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is an osteopathic physician specializing in functional medicine. She says muscles function well beyond locomotion and aesthetics.&nbsp;</p><p>“Muscle is the organ of longevity and your survivability is directly related to the quality of your muscle tissue,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Lyon has made a career studying, training and optimizing muscle. She’s a former fitness model and nationally ranked fitness competitor. In her private practice in New York City, many of her patients are part of elite military special operations, such as Navy SEALS, Green Berets, Army Rangers and Canadian Assaulters.</p><p>Her core Muscle-Centric-Medicine™ philosophy centers on muscle as an endocrine organ and how it determines the way in which we age, our body composition, obesity, and insulin resistance. As an endocrine organ, she explains, muscle is your “metabolic currency.”</p><p>We talk about the Carnivore Diet, carbs, protein and fat ratios, and false plant-based narratives—and what those things mean for health and aging.</p><p>“Veganism in and of itself is what, 100 years old?,” says Dr. Lyon. “We simply weren't designed to do that as it relates to muscle tissue, as it relates to aging, and it's just not how we are biologically designed.”</p><p>“It's so interesting when you think about fat and you think about carbohydrates,” she says. “Some people will say fat is good for you. You've got other people that will say that it's not, and sugar. No one will argue that Twinkies are bad for you. But when it comes to dietary protein because it has a face, people make very emotional decisions and totally ignore the science.”</p><p>Listen on to find out much more about why protein matters for your muscles and the state of your health.</p><p>&nbsp;Enjoy the show!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, my guest, Greg Wells, Ph.D., shares ways to fully rest your body and your mind. You’ve likely been under some measure of sustained stress pretty much the whole first half of 2020. It’s taken a toll on your physical and mental health. And maybe your financial and social health, too.</p><p>Greg’s new book,&nbsp;“<a href=\"https://drgregwells.com/books-1\" target=\"_blank\">Rest, Refocus, Recharge: A Guide for Optimizing Your Life</a>,”&nbsp;came out just a few months ago as lockdowns were getting underway across the world. So, our conversation about health and human performance, particularly under extreme conditions, is particularly relevant.</p><p>He’s a scientist and physiologist who makes the science of human limits understandable and actionable.&nbsp;He became a physiologist because he broke his neck body surfing in the ocean at age 15 while at a swim team training camp. That sparked his interest in the human body and how it adapts. He made a full recovery and swam in University ultimately making it to the World Cup level.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s also a travel and expedition adventurer who has journeyed through every imaginable terrain and conditions in over 50 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout all of his athletic endeavors and adventures, breathing was paramount. We explore the breathing techniques for different activities and situations, what science is learning about the breath-brain connection, and how to go beyond flow.</p><p>“There's a medulla in the brain, which is where we control breathing,” Greg says. “It’s actually linked to the center of the brain that is also involved in stress regulation. If you take long, slow, deep breaths, you know that you can calm the body down. You can actually feel it. If anyone just takes three deep breaths right now, you're going to relax.”</p><p>“The other end of that spectrum,” he continues, “is if you want to activate the nervous system, you can exhale really hard. That's why tennis players for example, scream and exhale when they hit the ball. That activates the nervous system and increases your stress and your explosiveness. In between those two extremes are all the other things that we can do with our breathing.”</p><p>Greg offers simple and innovative ways that you can slow down. Whether you’re in a sport, doing a work project or spending time with your family, knowing how to breathe the right way at the right time is a true game-changer. You can also stop using a morning alarm and start using a bedtime alarm instead. Listen on to find out how!</p><p>&nbsp;Enjoy the show!

I’ve brought a guest on the show today to talk about ways you can get real with yourself about how you’re getting rest wrong. It’s not sleep. And it’s not simply stopping activity. What she had to say certainly gave me pause, and I think you’ll do the same.</p><p>Dr. Saundra Dalton-Smith is a board-certified internal medicine physician, work-life integration researcher, speaker, and best-selling author. She’s been the featured wellness expert for numerous media outlets including MSNBC, Dr. Oz,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90398474/how-to-take-breaks-that-are-right-for-you\" target=\"_blank\">Fast Company</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/wander-woman/201903/how-regain-your-energy-throughout-your-day\" target=\"_blank\">Psychology Today</a>. She joins me from the Birmingham, Alabama, area where she’s practiced clinical medicine for over 20 years.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that we haven’t been doing enough of during the coronavirus pandemic is resting. Not sleeping, but actual&nbsp;<strong><em>rest</em></strong>. Stress and anxiety have been high for months.&nbsp;</p><p>In her book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Rest-Recover-Energy-Restore/dp/1478921684/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" target=\"_blank\">Sacred Rest: Recover Your Life, Renew Your Energy, Restore Your Sanity</a>, she describe seven types of rest that underlie how we show up in the world. All of them affect your performance in different and unexpected ways. Find out which one allows you to experience beauty, which one affects your authentic self and which one attacks your senses.&nbsp;</p><p>“Rest really is about restorative activity,” Dr. Dalton-Smith says. “What are the restorative activities you do to help pour back into these seven areas to counteract the ways that you pour out within your day-to-day life.”</p><p>As a teaser, I’ll let you know that you pay a steep price if you’re not getting one of the seven types&nbsp;–&nbsp;emotional rest.</p><p>“The part of emotional rest that gets very difficult and that I tend to see a lot in professionals is when it gets to the level where it's affecting people to the point where they don't feel like their life has worth,” Dr. Dalton-Smith says. “So, we're seeing suicide and depression and those types of things when emotional rest gets to a climax. And the problem with that is, if no one knows that you are down or depressed or anxious, then intrinsically, you start feeling like something is wrong with the true me, that I can't really let people see who I really am. And that's a very toxic situation to be in and that kind of increases the risk of some of these greater levels of mental health diseases.”</p><p><strong>To see how well you may or may not be resting, take the&nbsp;Rest Quiz at&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://ichoosemybestlife.com/quiz/rest-quiz-test/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://ichoosemybestlife.com/quiz/rest-quiz-test/</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Enjoy the show!

He’s also a Buddhist Meditation Master, and seamlessly blends Eastern and Western schools of thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Attachment lays the foundation for your sense of self and that informs your future relationships. “Relationships are purposeful. We select unconsciously to play out the same old conflict over and over again rather than working it out,” says Dr. Brown.</p><p>But you&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;change the pattern.</p><p>Self-development “starts with self-definition, knowing who you are, knowing what qualities represent the best self,” Dr. Brown says. “Then the next thing is what's called self-agency. What makes you feel like you have an impact on the environment around you, the world around you, in general. And then more specifically, that you have an impact on relationships with others. You're actually eliciting the kind of responses you want in relationship with others. So that's called self-agency.

He also teaches hypnotherapy.&nbsp;He’s been&nbsp;on the faculty for nearly 40 years.&nbsp;</p><p>We explore how early childhood attachment can define your relationships positively or negatively. As the world-leading expert on attachment theory, Dr. Brown shares share his research findings and give you options.</p><p>“There are two relational maps,” says Dr. Brown. “The first one forms about 12 to 20 months. That's the attachment map. The second one forms about the third and fourth year of life. That's called CCRT or Core Conflict Relationship Theme map. The difference between those two maps is the second map is much more complicated, and it's much more accessible to memory. The difference, put simply, is that there's a difference between whether you have trouble&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;relationships or&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;relationships.”</p><p>Dr. Brown also expanded his work to study the Buddhist approach.</p><p>“In the West we study psychopathology and psychiatric conditions,” he says. “In Buddhism, they studied positive states, so that's the other half of the map. Once you've worked through the negative stuff, all that leaves you with is a basic everyday unhappiness. If you work on developing the mind in the positive sense, you will be onto happiness and contentment in life, into awakening.”</p><p>I asked Dr. Brown how people could fix the broken stuff if they had early childhood trauma and were struggling in their adult relationships. He offers hope, treatments and says no one is left behind if they need help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The other really cool thing we get into is hypnosis, which is actually just a “talent for heightened attentiveness.” Dr. Brown worked for over 100 hours with Sirhan Sirhan, the man accused of assassinating Robert F.

His Mars/Venus book series has forever changed the way men and women view their relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>For more than 20 years, he’s helped couples deepen their intimacy and rejuvenate their love lives.&nbsp;His newest title (of nearly two dozen books), “Beyond Mars and Venus: Relationship Skills for Today's Complex World,” covers love and sex in our modern life.</p><p>His many books, blogs and free online workshops at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://marsvenus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MarsVenus.com</a>&nbsp;provide practical insights to improve relationships at all stages of life and love.&nbsp;You don’t want to miss our discussion of the many layers of sexuality and how men and women approach intimacy differently.</p><p>Hormonal balance plays a big role in sexual health. “Just as a rule of thumb,” John says, “anytime a man is passive, irritable, depressed, angry, frustrated, grumpy, his testosterone is low.” Women are affected by rising and falling estrogen levels, as well. Biologically, hormones rule sex lives, so it’s important that we recognize what our bodies are doing.</p><p>On a practical level, John walks listeners through nine types of orgasm, the benefits of sex without ejaculating and how people can become desensitized by porn or overstimulation.&nbsp;</p><p>“When you're with someone in physical touching,” John says, “there's a lot of different hormones that get produced to keep sex from being overstimulating because anything which is overstimulating destimulates you, desensitizes your ability to be turned on to your partner.”</p><p>He also offers some interesting tips and techniques that can increase both your partner’s sexual pleasure and your own.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

Her newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatburnfix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Fatburn Fix: Boost Energy, End Hunger, and Lose Weight by Using Body Fat for Fuel</a>, will take you on a uniquely informed nutrition journey focused on your own fat and the fats you consume.</p><p>Dr. Cate created previously developed a nutrition program for the LA Lakers that many NBA and professional sports teams adopted and still use today.

Anybody who says I'm promoting a fad diet, no. This is the opposite of the fad diet. It's the antidote to this experimental fad diet that we've been on.”</p><p>Dr. Cate says the&nbsp;<em>kind</em>&nbsp;of fat that’s in our own bodies is the root of inflammation. She then offers&nbsp;up four of the best things you can do nutritionally to boost your own immunity and beat inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;During this pandemic, you have to be aware of any inflammation in your body. If you’re living on sugar and bad oils, well, that’s just what coronavirus thrives on, she says. While many parts of the world are slowing returning to a new normal, Covid-19 hasn’t gone away.

This leads to widespread blood clotting in the lungs.</p><p>He explains what all this means in real terms you can understand. He’s been deep into new research and is one of the authors of a study that was just published in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p><p>Dr Li is an experienced internal medicine physician and author of the book, “Eat to Beat Disease.” He’s also&nbsp;a research scientist—specifically a vascular biologist. He’s been actively involved in angiogenesis research and clinical analysis for more than two decades. Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels and Dr. Li is one of the world’s leading experts in this field.</p><p>“Endothelium is just a fancy word to describe the cells that line the lining of our blood vessels,” Dr. Li says. “Endothelium is the connector that brings blood, oxygen, nutrients, everything to every single cell in our body, and if we block those channels, we wind up actually having big problems that happen in the heart, happen in the brain, and then diabetes.”</p><p>“It's actually very rare that you actually find a virus or bacteria invading an endothelial cell,” explains Dr. Li. But Covid-19 changed that game.</p><p>“We actually saw for the first time viruses invading endothelial cells and filling them up like a gumball machine. They were literally like zombies getting in infecting and then basically pulverizing the membranes from the inside out. There's something very unusual about this.”</p><p>Dr. Li and I talk about how Covid-19 acts more like a cold than the flu and other weird things. “The other thing we saw is massive inflammation–your immune system trying to clear out the virus in the infected endothelium,” he says.</p><p>Listen on as Dr. Li and I go way into the newest research about what else Covid-19 is doing in the human body and what you can do to strengthen your own immunity.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

We’re going to talk about the ways she defies, liberates, and transforms—and teaches others to do the same—in businesses and in life.&nbsp;</p><p>“We can go back in, we can reprogram our subconscious mind, which is actually the birthplace of those original, that bad, well, old code, let’s call it old code,” Suzy says. “Because it’s not bad code because it was written for survival. But we can actually change that code and then we can start creating a different reality based on that new change. It’s really programming. I call it biohacking consciousness, but it’s actually reprogramming.”</p><p>From failure to process to managing crisis, Suzy’s refreshingly candid perspective will give you something to think about.</p><p><strong>Light It Up:</strong>&nbsp;“Prior to [age] 38 was push, push, grind, grind, going towards something that I thought was actually going to make me happy,” Suzy says. “It was going to make me whole and complete. And then after the second bankruptcy, when I bottomed out, I was able to really look back and face myself. Now, what I say is, what’s worse than losing everything you have, is realizing you didn’t even have a good time doing it.” … “at least if the rug gets pulled out from underneath me again, I could look back and say I had a great time.”</p><p><strong>Lean Out</strong>: “It’s easy for a company to get fat and all these processes and processes and processes,” Suzy says. “I’m a renegade, I’m a rebel, and we have so many processes, everything becomes slow and I’m always about keeping as many processes as we need, but not too many.”&nbsp;… “When you’re small and nimble and flexible, you can move quickly like that. The big guys can’t do that and that’s our advantage is the speed and agility.”</p><p><strong>Consider Crisis:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;“You don’t have to know what you're doing, but also if you don’t like figuring stuff out, really question if you want to be an entrepreneur,” Suzy says. “If it doesn't turn you on to solve these problems and be in crisis after crisis after crisis and don’t even go there.”]</p><p><strong>Could Be&nbsp;Ayahuasca</strong>: “I don’t believe plant medicines by themselves,” Suzy says. “I believe they show you, they kick the door open, but you have to come back and actually do the integration work. Do the real life work like the amends, just because you've done the thing you need to apologize for.”</p><p>Enjoy the show!

Abdul Hayy Lammert Holdijk shares his profound life story of adventure, spirituality seeking, questioning tradition and teaching others.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Holland, Abdul lived in Germany and attended universities in the U.S. and London. His travels as a young man took him to Sri Lanka, Beirut, and&nbsp;Damascus, where he found his “home” in a mosque with a Sufi sheikh who spoke English.</p><p>He has been a follower of a Sufi path for the past 40 years, studying religion and consciousness with a hefty dose of pragmatism. Abdul taught at the American University in Beirut for several years, and then at the American University in Cairo for 35.</p><p>“Almost all what we would call the mystical traditions are embedded in an Orthodox tradition,” Abdul says. “And that has a reason. Religion is like a shell, like a Walnut. It's rigid, it's inflexible, but it protects what's inside. And the inside is the mystical tradition. It's what gives meaning and flavor and nourishment. And if you had the inside without the shell, it would just simply flow away. It would not survive.”</p><p>“One of the first things I read about Zen Buddhism that appealed to me was Burn the Sutras,” he continues. “It's only later that I understood, you go to have sutras to burn, right? And so the tradition are the sutras and yes, the inner tradition does burn that rigidity, but it doesn't burn it completely. Because the tradition provides the way, kind of resistance to your ego. And the ego is persistent.”&nbsp;</p><p>Abdul also founded the Egyptian Society of Homeopathy and teaches courses to other international homeopathy organizations.</p><p>He lectures on topics including the Enneagram, Shadow Work, Voice Dialogue, Love, Dream interpretation, Jekyll and Hyde, Hayy Ibn Yaqzan, and a wide range of other topics related to consciousness and personality development.

Susan challenges the prevailing attitude that we should “fix” our difficult emotions through positive thinking and chasing happiness. Instead, she teaches people how to thrive in an uncertain world.</p><p>After some hard-charging months focused on the science of coronavirus, and how to stay physically well and financially afloat during the pandemic, it’s time to put some attention on our emotional health.</p><p>“Fundamentally, the way we deal with our inner world drives everything,” Susan says. “It drives how we love and come to our relationships, how we live, how we parent and how we lead.”</p><p>Susan is an award-winning Harvard Medical School psychologist. Her bestselling book, “<a href=\"https://www.susandavid.com/new-index#about-the-book\" target=\"_blank\">Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life</a>” is based on 20 years of research and describes the psychological skills critical to thriving in times of uncertainty and change.</p><p>“At its most basic level emotional agility is about the capacity to be with ourselves,” Susan explains. “That includes our difficult thoughts and emotions and stories and past experiences in a way that's compassionate and curious and that doesn't hold us back from being the people that we most want to be. Because often we get stuck in our thoughts, our emotions and our stories, and we aren't living in a way that's intentional and values congruent and so it's about these different aspects.”</p><p>And whether we’re caught in a brooding trap or bottling up our emotions, it takes work to unpack what we’re feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>“For people to be healthy with themselves, with the inner worlds, these are not soft skills,” Susan says. “These are the most fundamental skills that we can have as human beings.”</p><p>So listen on to find out why trying to control what is uncontrollable wreaks havoc on our emotional health and what you can do to improve your inner landscape in spite of the world’s turmoil.</p><p>Enjoy the show!

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, I got to talk with Dr. Molly Maloof about why she wants to bring continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to the masses and how it can optimize nutrition and health.&nbsp;</p><p>CGM is the ultimate lifestyle biomarker. “I don't think CGM should be a prescription device,” Dr, Molly says.&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think the information about your body should not be behind a pharmacist's desk. It's absurd that you have to ask your doctor for information about yourself.”</p><p>Her goal is to maximize human potential by radically extending human health span through personal health technologies, scientific wellness and educational media. Dr. Molly teaches a course at Stanford University on strategies for extending health span for longer lifespan. Her concierge medical practice is oriented around optimizing health and improving mitochondrial function.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is not acceptable that we are getting so sick so young and we need to ask ourselves ‘what are all the possible causes,’ ” she says. “A lot of it does have to do with how we eat, how we live, how we breathe.” EMFs are in the mix, too.</p><p>Dr. Molly’s aim is to redesign the healthcare system by reducing medicine prescriptions and implementing healthy lifestyle principles, like fasting.</p><p>“We're designed to be fasting most of the time,” she says. “We're not designed to be eating all the time, We have the genetics of scarcity and so abundance is actually damaging to health. Food is fundamental to health. If your food is wrong, your fuel is wrong, you're screwed.”</p><p>She’s a passionate evangelist, empowering advocate and visionary futurist who is pioneering new approaches to personal health. “This is the whole crux of what biohacking is about, right? Like having to hack a system because it won't give you what you want, why can't people learn about their bodies? What's wrong with that?”</p><p>Enjoy the show!

He teaches people how to rewire their brains and recondition their bodies to make lasting changes. His work combines neuroscience, epigenetics, and quantum physics to explore the science behind spontaneous remissions and healing.&nbsp;</p><p>“I talk about how the mind and body are connected and how we can begin to change who we are and that we're not hardwired to be a certain way for the rest of our lives, and we're not doomed by our genes,” Dr. Joe says. “In fact, we're marvels of adaptability and change.”</p><p>He’s an international lecturer, researcher, corporate consultant, author, and educator.</p><p>In his advanced workshops around the world, he has partnered with other scientists to perform extensive research on the effects of meditation, including epigenetic testing, brain mapping with electroencephalograms (EEGs), and individual energy field testing with a gas discharge visualization (GDV) machine. His research also includes measuring heart coherence with HeartMath monitors.</p><p>“I think there's power in numbers,” Dr. Joe says. “The higher the amplitude, the higher the energy. And if you get enough people thinking the same way, feeling the same way, doing the same things, and you can get and train them into that frequency.” That’s where the magic of healing and transformation happens.”</p><p>In a simple, inspiring, and compassionate way, Dr. Joe shows people how they can take their new knowledge to help heal illnesses, chronic conditions and diseases, and also evolve their consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>“People are beginning to understand that it is more possible when see the evidence in front of them,” Dr. Joe says. “And that's a footprint in consciousness. And so we have evidence in the scientific world, we have evidence in testimony, and I think evidence is the loudest voice.”</p><p>However you’re managing the current global pandemic, you have an opportunity to look within, grow, learn and even speed up your belief in what’s possible.&nbsp;</p><p>“So keep doing the work,” Dr. Joe says. “Keep working on yourself. Keep applying it. Try it out. Be a scientist in your life. Experiment. Make it fun. Open up and see if you can begin to produce effects in your life and when you do pay attention to what you did and do it again until you get really good at it.”</p><p>Enjoy the show!

Top executive coach, marketing expert, and $21.7 Billion Dollar Man—Jay Abraham—joins Dave for a candid discussion about financial health. Especially as the Covid-19 pandemic has blown apart the economy.</p><p>“Everyone is shell-shocked,” Jay says. “Even big companies are out of money.”</p><p>As Founder and CEO of The Abraham Group, Inc. (Los Angeles, California), Jay has dealt with virtually every type of business scenario and issue. He has studied, and solved, almost every type of business question, challenge and opportunity. He’s spent his entire career solving complex problems and fixing underperforming businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have a broad perspective,” Jay says. “I've been trained to find opportunity at adversity.”</p><p>His forte, which is the ability to think “way outside the box” while thinking “way inside the box” too, is to prepare for multiple potential scenarios. This has enabled him to find (and successfully implement) creative, pre-emptive solutions in order to generate high-performance results. You can, too, even in this incredibly tough business environment.&nbsp;</p><p>“You start with nonthreatening, no-risk things, because every day, you could be putting into play one small revenue activity that can start monetizing for you,” Jay says. “They don't all have to be winners and they don't have to be big.”</p><p>This episode is full of useful and practical ways you can do something about your current financial situation. The opportunities are there if you let yourself think in new ways.</p><p>“What you can do from the base of what's happened is transcendent,” Jay says. “It's extraordinary if you allow yourself to transcend the limitations of how you have seen yourself—whether you're a displaced employee, whether you're a restauranteur, whether you're an entrepreneur whose business has faltered, or whether you're one that's doing okay.”</p><p><strong>SPECIAL GIVEAWAYS FOR BULLETPROOF RADIO LISTENERS</strong></p><p>Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://daveasprey.com/jay/\" target=\"_blank\">https://daveasprey.com/jay/</a>&nbsp;for your chance to win any one of these great resources by Jay Abraham:</p><ul><li><strong>“The Sticking Point Solution: 9 Ways to Move Your Business from Stagnation to Stunning Growth in Tough Economic Times\"</strong></li><li><strong>“Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got:&nbsp;21 Ways You Can Out-Think, Out-Perform, and Out-Earn the Competition\"</strong></li><li><strong>“The Creativity Switch: How To Unleash&nbsp;The Creative Power Within You\"</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Enjoy the show!

Covid-19 has turned a spotlight on problems within industrial meat processing. But there’s another way that keeps workers safe and product quality high for consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>There are small-scale farmers and meat processors providing total integrity throughout the value chain. Preserving natural ecosystems, respecting animals, and protecting the environment are simply the way they do business. Plus, they’ve got science on their side proving why grass-fed, pasture-raised livestock is both the healthiest—and most humane—meat choice.</p><p><strong>Cody Hopkins</strong>&nbsp;is a physicist who decided to be a farmer, then founded Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative in Arkansas and serves as its CEO. He and the Grass Roots partner farms are changing the way meat is produced and consumed across the U.S. He’s focused on regenerative agriculture, animal welfare, sustainability and blockchain technology.</p><p>“There is a growing awareness of the vulnerability of our meat supply chain, especially at the processing level,” Cody says. “When one company or one plant produces 130 million servings every week, it's producing 5% of the country's pork. That is a scary position to be in and I think people are really waking up to that right now.”</p><p><strong>Andy Shaw</strong>, CEO of Cypress Valley Meat Company in Arkansas, has more than 20 years of experience in all aspects of meat processing. He oversees multiple USDA-inspected processing plants that service Grass Roots, major retailers and farmers, and private label products for renowned restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p>“When you look at what people have said in the past of being too big to fail, we're seeing quite the opposite now,” Andy says. “I think they're [industrial meat processing plants] too big to stay continually in motion while all this is going on. When you’ve got that many employees concentrated in one location, it's almost impossible to keep everybody healthy and at work.

I previously had him on episode&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.daveasprey.com/robert-rowen-352/\" target=\"_blank\">#352</a>&nbsp;to talk about how he successfully treated Ebola patients in Africa with ozone therapy.</p><p>I wanted Dr. Rowen back on the show now because of his extensive expertise. “There’s hydrogen peroxide, ozone, ultraviolet, and intravenous Vitamin C,” he says. “These all belong to a family of therapies commonly referred to as oxidative medicine. And it is a really natural therapy, most people don't realize that. Our immune cells (white blood cells) go after infection by making oxidants and tossing them at the invader. Now, if this didn't work, we wouldn't be here. And the invaders have never been able to get away from this.”</p><p>Dr. Rowen also recently published a paper in the<em>&nbsp;Journal of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology&nbsp;</em>to bring attention to ozone therapy as a novel treatment for conventionally untreatable viral illnesses, such as coronavirus.</p><p>“Ozone is reducing inflammation, modulating inflammation, delivering more oxygen, improving mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and ozone itself is toxic, so it kills microorganisms,” he says.</p><p>Ozone therapy has stood the test of time in my life and for the last 100 years, it's the real deal.

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, my guest, Rick Hanson, Ph.D., is a&nbsp;neuropsychologist, teacher, and speaker. He’s also a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;best-selling author of five books that&nbsp;explore topics like neuroscience, clinical psychology, and positive neuroplasticity.</p><p>I’ve asked Rick back to the show to discuss his new book, “<a href=\"https://www.rickhanson.net/books/\" target=\"_blank\">Neurodharma: New Science, Ancient Wisdom, and Seven Practices of the Highest Happiness</a>.” We cover Rick’s seven practices for strengthening the neural circuitry of profound contentment and inner peace based on cutting-edge brain science. These qualities offer essential support in everyday life while at the same time support the exploration of the most radical reaches of human consciousness.&nbsp;If it sounds daunting, it’s absolutely not! Rick relies on methods and prefers to be in the trenches.</p><p>“These are&nbsp;seven ways of being that are perfected in enlightenment,” Rick says. “And then in effect, reverse engineering those seven ways of being so that we can develop them inside ourselves, literally hardwired into our own brain.”</p><p>He gives us hope while also recognizing the challenges of modern life: “Our deepest nature in fact has already awakened,” he says. “And yet it's really difficult to rest in that true nature for more than a few seconds in a row given the brain's survival biases and then the ways that modern culture floods us and distracts us.” …&nbsp;“It’s easy to lose sight of the peaks of human potential.”</p><p>Rick is a Senior Fellow of UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center.&nbsp;He’s lectured at NASA, Google, Oxford, and Harvard, and taught in meditation centers worldwide. Considered an expert on positive neuroplasticity, his work has been featured on the BBC, CBS, NPR, and other major media.&nbsp;</p><p>Rick doesn’t use any jargon or pep talks, but instead reaches into neuroscience while also sharing his own journey of practice (he’s been meditating for 46 years!) He teaches and informs through stories, guided meditations, examples and applications. You’ll find this episode pragmatic and practical.</p><p>Enjoy the show!</p><p>Catch my recorded IG Live with Rick on YouTube at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J1XWHSbWyfI\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/J1XWHSbWyfI</a>.

I asked him to come in for this special short podcast because I wanted to talk specifically about immune function and stem cells, and get thoughts from one of the leaders in the field on stem cells, and Covid-19, and viruses, and immunity.&nbsp;</p><p><em>DISCLAIMER: Dr. Harry Adelson wishes to be clear that he does not treat COVID-19 under any circumstance, with stem cells or anything else. He leaves that to the infectious&nbsp;disease specialists.</em></p><p>Dr. Adelson founded Docere Clinics, in Park City, Utah, in 2002 where he practiced Regenerative Injection Therapy until 2010. Since then, he's been treating exclusively musculoskeletal pain conditions using stem cells. He has performed over 6,000 stem cell procedures, putting him solidly among the most experienced in the world.</p><p>We discuss stem cells and the connections to inflammation from viruses specifically. “Of the modalities that are being studied, stem-cell therapy actually potentially shows the most promise,” Dr. Adelson says.

Our conversation explores kindness, empathy, and compassion. You’ll find out the surprising ways people carry these traits into their personal lives and their broader social groups and communitites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a stack rank, kindness wins: “So kindness is, obviously, I think the most important for us as a collective,” Jamil says. “We need to cooperate, we need to work together, and that's whether you're in a family or a company or a culture.”</p><p>Jamil has presented and written extensively about kindness and empathy, with featured articles in the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>,&nbsp;<em>The New Yorker</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Atlantic</em>&nbsp;and many more publications and media outlets.

            "description": "\n        <p>This episode of Bulletproof Radio is part one of a special two-part series. There was a lot to discuss about Covid-19 with Mansoor Mohammed, Ph.D.,&nbsp;president and chief scientific officer of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thednacompany.com/pages/dr-mansoor-mohammed\" target=\"_blank\">The DNA Company</a>.</p><p>Today’s guest is widely regarded as a pioneer in medical genomics and has been the recipient of multiple academic and industry awards. He’s the holder of several patents in the general fields of molecular diagnostics and genomics research. Now you might think that we’re going to get into something scienc-y about DNA and coronavirus—and we are, but there’s so much more to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, how DNA impacts your ability to fight Covid-19 and the vast ripple effect this pandemic is having across the world. There’s also an emotional effect, secondary to the pandemic, that very few people are talking about in any meaningful way.</p><p>Hardcore stress, anxiety, social isolation, employment and education disruption, and safety and security concerns are moving in waves across the world. Cortisol levels are up, inflammation is triggered, circadian rhythms are off, eating habits are upset—all making for a swirling storm of physical and mental health concerns beyond having the actual virus. For all of us.</p><p>And while it seems the Covid-19 illness doesn’t seem to be affecting youth as much as adults, we may be “leaving the youth out of the equation,” says Mansoor. “But those youth are equally likely to be affected by the emotional discord of seeing mom and dad scared, mom and dad fighting, parents worried, and they may not have the barometers by which to filter all of the stress that's societally going on.”</p><p>Turns out there’s a genetic link to how we process trauma.&nbsp;A percentage of our youth have a “profound genomic makeup that significantly predisposes them to a much more anxiety based, much more war-based response to what's going on,” Mansoor says. Adults are not immune, either. I had Mansoor check my own DNA; listen on to what he found.</p><p>“We're performing a societal experiment right now,” Mansoor continues. “And we need to be aware of this and we need to be aware of the multitude of effects this is going to have—not just acute viral infection and acute hospitalization. There are broader effects here that we need to speak of.”</p><p>Enjoy the show!&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

My guest has defied incredible odds throughout her life to accomplish some extraordinary things.</p><p>Amy Purdy follows a road of her own making—as a motivational speaker, a New York Times best-selling author, a model, dancer and actress—and also the most decorated American Paralympic snowboarder in history.</p><p>She toured the United States with Oprah Winfrey, speaking to stadiums of people about her life: losing both legs at 19.&nbsp;By sharing her incredible story, she taught others about resilience and inspired them to follow their dreams.</p><p>Her life took another turn in 2019—this time a severe health setback. We’re going to talk about what happened and how she hacked her body and mind through her recovery.</p><p>When it comes to excruciating pain, adversity, and continually moving forward, Amy has worked through it all with strength and grace.</p><ul><li><strong>Perseverance</strong>: “Even when I survived, I think, it made me have to really dig deep and figure out, okay, there's certain things I can change, there's certain things I can't, so I decided to really focus on the things that I could change, I decided to focus on what I&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;do.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Hope</strong>: “I still wanted to live a great life. I was still me, I very much so still felt like me. I'm the same person, the same drive, the same aspirations. I wanted to travel, I wanted to snowboard all over the world. I still wanted to do all of that. I just now had to figure out how, and I had to get creative to find a way.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Positivity</strong>: “It didn't feel good to have people feel sorry for me. And so I knew that I didn't want to feel sorry for myself. I thought ‘that's a bad spot to be in.’ ”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Mindset</strong>: “One major thing that I did was I got really good at compartmentalizing because I was dealing with losing my legs, losing my kidney function and needing a kidney transplant and then losing part of my hearing as well, all at the same time.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Focus</strong>: “When I think of all my accomplishments, the things that I've done in my life, I get very hyper-focused. I kind of shut everything else away and just focus on what needs to be taken care of.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Healing</strong>: “I&nbsp;started this whole new journey that I'm on of fighting to get back. … I realize the doctors have done what they can. Now it's up to my body to do the rest and how can I support my body to not just heal but literally do more than that, right?

After using them for a period of time, “There's a noticeable difference in how you feel, how you think, how you sleep,” Dr. Heather says.</p><p>And while she works with a broad range of peptides, she has her favorites. “I think that my love with epitalon is... I love that peptide. I think it's the most understated peptide in our toolbox and I use it a lot. It has tremendous capability and it works in so many different areas.

She’s also an associate professor of neuroscience in neurology and radiology at Weill Cornell and an adjunct faculty member at New York University’s Department of Psychiatry.</p><p>Her current scientific work focuses on the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease in at-risk people, particularly women. More than a decade of research has shown two things, Dr. Mosconi says: “No. 1, Alzheimer's Disease is not a disease of old age, but rather the disease starts with negative changes in the brain years—if not decades—before any clinical symptoms emerge. So, we're looking at midlife, rather than when you're 70 or 80. No. 2, women tend to develop these negative changes in their brains before men do, and specifically as women go through menopause. That was a big finding.”</p><p>“Menopause symptoms don't start in the ovaries,” she says, “they start in the brain.” That’s why&nbsp;Dr. Mosconi uses brain imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&nbsp;</p><p>She is passionately interested in how risk of memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease can be mitigated, if not prevented, through the combination of appropriate medical care and lifestyle modifications involving diet, nutrition, physical and intellectual fitness.

It doesn't mean we're dangerous. It doesn't mean were death-wish kind of thing. It just means we're out and interested in stimulation, learning, curiosity, and new things.”</p><p>She’s dived deeper into caves than any woman in history and set a women's world record for deep cave penetration. She became the first person to dive the ice caves of&nbsp;Antarctica, going further into an underwater cave system than any woman ever.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I do choose to take risks, I'm very, very careful about assessing risks, trying to prevent as many things that could go wrong, pre-visualizing what could happen underwater, and then ensuring that I have the right training, the right personnel, the right equipment, and redundancy with me, so that I can handle that worst case possible scenario,” Jill says.</p><p>She’s completed more than 7,500 dives in her career so far and says, “We are capable of so much more than we could possibly imagine.”</p><p>Considered a legend in the diving community, she's spent more than three decades in submerged caves around the world partnering with National Geographic, NOAA, and various educational institutions and television networks worldwide. She’s also a writer and award-winning photographer and filmmaker who takes a keen interest in the health of our Earth’s oceans.</p><p>In recognition of her lifetime achievement, Jill was awarded the inaugural Sir Christopher Ondaatje Medal for Exploration. Established by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 2013, the medal recognizes singular achievements and the pursuit of excellence by an outstanding Canadian explorer. She also is the first Explorer in Residence for the society.</p><p>Jill says cave diving is “one of the most dangerous, yet exhilarating, pursuits in the world.” In our conversation, we talk about her adventures underwater and how her survival depends on how she balances risk, fear and the right amount of breathing.</p><p>“I'm scared all the time,” Jill says, “because I think being scared means that I care about the outcome.”</p><p>Enjoy the show!&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

FIT AI</a>&nbsp;co-founders on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.daveasprey.com/carolfit-ai-615/\" target=\"_blank\">episode #615</a>&nbsp;of Bulletproof Radio about how to hack your cardiovascular system with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://carolfitai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CAR.O.L.</a></p><p>“With a 20-second sprint, you're increasing your energy demand above rest substantially,” Lance says. “That's a severe disruption to your homeostasis. And as a result of that, you're putting in motion a variety of upregulation of metabolic pathways that allow you to provide energy that will regenerate ATP so that you can keep sprinting for 20 seconds. And the research is pretty clear that we've identified that minimum time that turns on these pathways, 20 seconds, two bouts a day, and that's sufficient.”</p><p>Lance teaches in both the Exercise and Sport Science and High-Altitude Exercise Physiology programs. He researches primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases through evidence-based interventions like exercise and nutrition and quantifies the energy expenditure of outdoor and non-traditional types of physical activity. His research into CAR.O.L. culminated in a paper published in the&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Environmental Research</em>&nbsp;<em>and Public Health:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6388288/\" target=\"_blank\">“Reduced Exertion High-Intensity Interval Training is More Effective at Improving Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Cardiometabolic Health than Traditional Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training.”</a></p><p>Lance has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles, delivered 30 conference proceedings, and written 10 book chapters.

(EFT for short.)&nbsp;He’s also&nbsp;been on Bulletproof Radio before. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.daveasprey.com/dawson-church/\" target=\"_blank\">episode 474</a>, we talked about all things&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.daveasprey.com/eft-tapping-for-anxiety-stress/\" target=\"_blank\">tapping</a>&nbsp;and he led me through an EFT session on that podcast. He has conducted dozens of clinical trials and founded the National Institute for Integrative Healthcare to promote groundbreaking new treatments. He’s studied the effects of meditation on the brain and tapping as a technique to help people heal from physical, emotional and mental challenges.</p><p>As an award-winning author and researcher, his book “The Genie in Your Genes” linked emotions and genetics. His follow-up book, “Mind to Matter” examined the science of peak mental states. We discuss his forthcoming book, “Bliss Brain,” and the surprising science of the brain he discovered in his research and study of brain waves.</p><p>“One of the big mysteries of neuroscience for decades was that the brain activity doesn't fluctuate by more than 5% up or down, day or night,” he says. “When you relax, your brain doesn't relax. Your brain activity just stays at the same high level.” … “When you're not doing a task, the brain sees all this unused spare capacity and it says, \"Great. Let's grab this.\" And it grabs it to such a consistent degree that we call that the default mode network.”</p><p>Listen on to learn more about brain activity and the fascinating way it bridges your consciousness.</p><p><strong>*This episode contains a mini session guided by Dawson that is a allows you to quickly access an altered state of consciousness.</strong></p><p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n      ",

The benefit of making a single good choice is fine, but the benefit of making a string of good choices can be significantly better. You're really trying to string those two together.”</p><p>His work has appeared in many media outlets, including&nbsp;<em>Entrepreneur</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;magazines, the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;and on&nbsp;<em>CBS This Morning</em>.

Most of these probiotics were just getting into the gut and dying, dying before they ever got into the intestines. So, we looked at the research.”</p><p>“You've got this gauntlet that microbes have to get through when they go through the oral cavity in order to be alive and function in the gut,” Kiran continues. “So, our question was, are there microbes that can naturally do that?”</p><p>The more we’re researching the human microbiome, the more we’re learning about the connection between the gut and all other human body and brain systems.

He knows all of this from first-hand experience. He’s spent over four decades in the Pacific Northwest studying and researching the world of mushrooms. He lectures extensively and his presentations cover a range of mushroom species and research showing how mushrooms can help the health of people and the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>From origins: “Over 500 million years ago, fungi were the first organisms come to land,” Paul says. “Just this past month [May 2019], they found new fossil records that pushes back the entrance of fungi onto land to a billion years ago. This is hundreds of millions of years before plants.”</p><p>To modern humans: “You and I are actually mycelial beings, and we are descendant of fungi,” he says. “Fungi are our ancestors.”</p><p>Paul says we’re intertwined with mushrooms at a cellular level. He believes that habitats have immune systems—just like people—and mushrooms are cellular bridges between the two. Our close evolutionary relationship to fungi can be the basis for novel pairings in the microbiome that lead to greater sustainability and immune enhancement.</p><p>And from neurogenesis to our microbiome to our mitochondria, fungi are linked to us. Part history lesson and all interesting, Paul’s stories are filled with intriguing discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>His research is considered revolutionary and is creating a paradigm shift for helping ecosystems worldwide.</p><p>As a special bonus in this episode, Paul shares exciting new information about his work with bees. “This'll be the first podcast that I'll be mentioning something that enables and empowers everybody on this planet to do something,” he says.

Literally.</p><p>“We have been in this arms race with plants as humans for millions of years,\" says Dr. Paul Saladino. “Plants are out to get us. They don't want us to eat them.”</p><p>Dr. Saladino is a certified functional medicine practitioner in San Diego who focuses on in-depth study of human behavior and diseases. His journey through healthcare has been quite varied. He was a practicing physician’s assistant in the field of cardiology for a number of years, then went on to earn a medical degree. He also obtained a functional medicine certification and recently completed a psychiatric residency.</p><p>Dr. Saladino's work promotes the use of science-based information to deeply understand the root causes of illness and provide individualized care that goes beyond traditional pharmacological treatments. “That's really led me to some strange and wild jungle holes of thought,” he admits.</p><p>He’s also passionate about researching connections between nutritional biochemistry and chronic disease, and the benefits of a Carnivore Diet. He believes that inflammation and autoimmune diseases are linked. “What we're dealing with in Western medicine is a tidal wave of chronic inflammation,” he says, “a tidal wave of autoimmunity.”</p><p>For the curious among you, this conversation explores a lot of “whys,” such as:</p><ul><li>Why our human bodies are designed for nose-to-tail animal consumption</li><li>Why you feel great eating raw meat&nbsp;</li><li>Why animal liver is a superfood&nbsp;</li><li>Why plant molecules don’t play nice with human biology</li><li>Why high-protein diets are terrible</li><li>Why you’re cooking your bacon wrong if you can hear it sizzling</li><li>Why you should consider putting the brakes on your grilling</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Listen on for a different perspective on how to ditch plants and amp up your meat: “I think what's cool is to be able to deliver knowledge that creates power leveraging this for better health outcomes,” Dr. Saladino says.</p><p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n      ",

I learned a lot, and I hope you will, too.&nbsp;</p><p>We talk about consciousness and how we can raise both our own and the collective to upgrade ourselves, our workplaces, our communities, and our planet. Here are some highlights in Matthew’s own words:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Responsibility:</strong>“I don't know if I was conscious of it at the time, but I knew that there was a great metaphor in what my father had told me, is that when there's a mess we all have a responsibility to do something to clean it up,”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Connection</strong>: “I think that spirituality is a kind of connectedness to all of the life that exists on the planet.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Ocean Plastic</strong>: “The greater problem is the decomposing of those plastics. It doesn't disappear, it just becomes smaller and smaller and becomes what we call microplastics.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Life</strong>:“You're a part of this great cycle of life, you know? You're not bigger or more important than it. You're maybe a keystone character in it, an important part of the chain, but you're not bigger and more important than the least of us.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Shared Humanity</strong>: “It is through the singing of songs and the telling of stories that we evolve culturally, that we learn to understand other people's points of view.”</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Enjoy the show!&nbsp;</p>\n      ",

In this conversation, we’re going in a different direction. We cover what happens to women’s body systems while they’re on hormonal birth control and then when they stop using it. There’s also research about what the pill depletes from women’s bodies. Essential supplementation is needed while taking birth control and also when stopping.</p><p>“There's a lot more going on with women's hormonal health that lends itself to this idea of, how crazy are we to give a medication, and to shut down a woman's reproductive system, and act like that's not going to have any long-term impacts, or any impact on her body as a whole?” Dr. Brighten says in our interview.</p><p>This is a must-listen episode for both women AND men. We get into alternative birth control methods—and how well they work. And why sex tends to get better when women go off hormonal birth control.

He’s currently the president of Platt Wellness Center in Rancho Mirage, California, where he specializes in bio-identical hormones, hormone balancing and the causation of illness.</p><p>We talk about his focus on treating health conditions caused by excess adrenaline, which can include fibromyalgia, autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, anger, weight gain, and addictions, among others—and how progesterone plays a major role in the solution.</p><p>“What people don't understand is that the primary reason why the body releases adrenaline is to provide fuel to the brain,” says Dr. Platt. “You can see from a survival standpoint, the body always wants to make sure the brain has enough fuel. It's normal for people to release adrenaline at certain times, but I use the term adrenaline dominance to indicate where those people have excess amounts of adrenaline, to the point that it actually has clinical consequences.”</p><p>Our conversation covers an assortment of questions, such as:</p><ul><li>Is adrenal fatigue real?</li><li>Can post-partum depression be eliminated with progesterone?</li><li>Is fibromyalgia pain a build-up of lactic acid in the muscles?</li><li>Is ADHD really about interest, rather than focus?</li><li>Should you be intermittent fasting if you have excess adrenaline?</li><li>Can you control adrenaline by controlling insulin?</li><li>Does blocking adrenaline prevent or eliminate stress?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Listen on to find out some interesting answers to these and many other questions during our discussion.

Born three minutes apart, the twins have been in sync ever since—both on and off the court. They are American professional doubles tennis players, gold-and bronze-winning Olympians, and are the most successful tennis duo of all time.</p><p>The two have won a record number of tour titles (118 at the time this episode airs) and have been finalists on 58 other occasions. They have a career Super Slam and 16 Grand Slam titles overall, which is more than any men's team in the Open Era.</p><p>The twins’ parents began coaching them at the age of two. The brothers turned pro in 1998 after attending Stanford University and winning two NCAA championships. Since then, they have amassed 118 ATP Tour Titles together, including a record 18 Grand Slams. Their Gold Medal win the 2012 Olympic games made them the only team in ATP history to hold all four Grand Slam titles&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;an Olympic Gold medal. The Bryans also have achieved the ATP Tour year-end No. 1 ranking for a record 10 years, and Mike recently celebrated his 500th&nbsp;week at No. 1 on the ATP Tour doubles rankings.</p><p>Their success is the result of a combination of hard work, mutual respect, and a passion for the game of tennis. (It also helps that one of the twins has a 140 mph lefty serve!)</p><p>But both Mike and Bob have suffered injuries that threatened to end their careers, including Bob’s&nbsp;recent hip surgery. At the age of 40, no one thought they would come back and continue to win, but they have—several times over. They’ve changed up their training regimen and put serious focus on recovery.</p><p>“You've got to set these goals and really work every day to do it,” Bob says. “It's being professional in every aspect of your life. I'm trying just to dial on the health as best as I can because when I'm done, I want to be able to play with my kids. I want to be able to walk down the street and not be limping or needing metal on every joint. That's my goal: to retire healthy but keep playing as long as we can.”</p><p>Today’s episode is going to be a good one as we talk about all the ways these professional athletes biohack to their advantage, how music keeps them in sync, and how they are helping at-risk kids.</p>\n      ",

He’s also a “New York Times” best-selling author of “I Hope I Screw This Up” and a transformational speaker who helps people release anxiety and fear on stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle comes from an extended family of entertainers. He started asking to do stand-up routines for his classmates in second grade. By 18, he was on a wild ride more than 250 nights a year headlining comedy shows. He did this for years at the expense of his physical and mental health. A bout of pneumonia took him down after a particularly brutal touring schedule; he developed crippling stage fright out of nowhere; and he was disparaged by the comedian community of which he’d been such an integral part. After that, he reassessed everything about himself and the life he’d been living.</p><p>I did not know who Kyle was until I met him at the summit. I sat next to him at dinner and thought “This guy has an amazing brain where we can talk about humor, and we can talk about how that turns into letting people really talk about what's going on.”&nbsp;</p><p>His wit is sharp, and his improv is hands-down amazing. Prepared remarks? Nah. Bullet points on a presentation? Nope. He’s the master of riffing and creative flow in the moment. And while he may be spontaneous, he’s deeply grounded in self-awareness. He believes strongly and says so. So instead of jokes, he shares insights about our all-so-common human condition during our interview. (As well as his foray into raw veganism and tuning into his body vibrations.) Here are some of his zingers:</p><ul><li><strong>Happiness</strong>: “I find that one illusion that every human is in, is the illusion of when something happens, I'll be happy.”</li><li><strong>Expectations</strong>: “I have a belief that no one can break your heart, but they&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;break your expectations.”</li><li><strong>Creativity</strong>: “I believe if you're not continually creating, your mind will creatively sabotage you.”</li><li><strong>Life</strong>: “A lot of us spend a lot of our life trying to protect a life that we're not living.”</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You’re going to learn a lot today from this interview, because Kyle uses humor in a way that gets way underneath what's&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;going on with you.</p>\n      ",

I actually really like my wireless devices. I think they're really useful, but I also know that they are not without a dark side.</p><p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, Peter shares how he recovered from the effects of high levels of wireless and EMF exposure, as well as mercury poisoning. He’s also spent the last 15 years successfully recovering his two sons from autism and sensory issues.</p><p>His efforts are now focused on raising awareness about the known health effects of wireless radiation and EMF (electromagnetic fields), both of which are listed as group 2B carcinogens by the World Health Organization. Peter is one of the leading funders in the country in this area of research, funding work at Harvard, Stanford, University of California-Berkeley and several leading environmental health non-profits.</p><p>“What we need to talk about in this area in general—and this goes for autism and chronic disease—is that it's total load, that it's never one thing.” Peter says. This is a mistake I made. This is a mistake everybody makes. You start out thinking it's genetic. Then you do diet and you start stuff.

These fungi are full of compounds and nutrients that your body will love. There’s a whole lot of science behind this now.</p><p>Julian Mitchell—co-founder and CEO of the Australian-based company Life Cykel—and his team are doing amazing work with mushrooms as innovative food sources and medicinals in Australia.</p><p>For day-to-day use, you’ll definitely want to go with cooked, not raw mushrooms. For those of you who aren’t fans of actually eating mushrooms, there’s an option for you, too: “Having it as a tincture makes it very easy to add to a coffee, add to a tea, add to a smoothie,” Julian says. “It's quite tasteless and at the same time micro-dosing it in small amounts straight into your mouth is a great way to have it as well and absorb it straight into your blood system.”</p><p>You’ll also learn about the naturally (sweet!) ingredient infused into the Life Cykel tinctures and powders. It’s a native Australian fruit rich in antioxidants and antiviral properties that amplifies the benefits of the mushrooms.</p><p>And for those of you who are chasing sleep, I&nbsp;found nothing else that increased my REM sleep as much as the specific extracts of one species, which I’ll tell you about during the show.</p><p>Mushrooms are having a moment—and likely many more. Here’s what Julian says:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>“Mushrooms and mushroom-based foods are going to play a huge role in the future of food. They grow quickly requiring very little resources in terms of water, power, and land. They have an amazing nutritional profile, and of course, they are 100% natural.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>“The more we look to the natural world for solutions, the better off we're going to be and so, mushrooms and the fungi kingdom are hugely important to our evolution.”</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>“Mushrooms are almost an uncharted continent, with infinite applications not just in food but in biotechnology.”</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It's going to be a fascinating episode.

She’s a remarkable business leader, author and the founder and CEO of Thrive Global — an organization that’s on a mission to unlock human potential.&nbsp;“The ultimate disruption is changing the way we work and live,” she says.</p><ul><li>In this delightful conversation—full of <strong>humor, wisdom and straight-up life advice</strong>—Dave and Arianna talk about prioritizing health, behavior change, habit stacking, the advance of AI, shifting workplace culture, and much more: “What I love is finding unexpected ways to work with people,” she says.</li><li>The discussion gets real about the<strong> damaging effects of stress and burnout</strong>: “It has become my mission to help wake up the world to the importance of sleep, of recovery, of recharging and realizing that, actually, if we want peak performance, these are tools in the tool box that we need,” Arianna says.</li><li>And they touch on the <strong>vital importance of human</strong> <strong>connection</strong> in an increasingly technical world: “Why not grow our eulogy virtues—not just our resume virtues—throughout our lives?” she says. To which Dave replies, “<em>That’s</em> a powerful statement.”</li></ul><p>We’re excited that you’ll be listening to what Arianna shares about the work she’s doing in the world to touch people’s hearts and souls.

He’s been conducting angiogenesis research and clinical analysis—angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels—for more than two decades and is considered to be one of the world’s leading experts in the field.</p><p>He’s also known for providing various food remedies for the prevention and treatment of advanced medical conditions like cancer, diabetes, blindness, and heart disease. And he’s most interested in the common denominators of disease—what unites and connects diseases across body systems and across human populations.</p><p>Today’s conversation focuses on the importance of taking a systems-based approach to health and the prevention, treatment, and reversal of disease. “That's where the tipping point comes,” says Dr. Li, “because when we think that we can prevent the disease or reverse the disease, we're suddenly in a completely different place than healthcare has been for 150 years.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Li gives practical examples of how foods used as medicine can boost the body’s five main defense systems: angiogenesis, regeneration, microbiome, DNA, and the immune system. “Our health is not simply the absence of disease,” he says. “Our health is the result of our hardwired defense systems that protect us from the day we're born until our very last breath. And guess what? Food can actually activate those health defenses.”</strong></p><p>Want to know how to downturn chronic inflammation or right-size your microbiome?

And at more than 23 million downloads, his “Dear Ken” podcast is one of the most-listened-to podcasts in Japan.</p><p>Ken began writing books about life work, life balance, wealth, and happiness in his early 30s after retiring from an accounting career.&nbsp;His financial expertise comes from owning and managing several businesses, including an accounting company, a management consulting firm, and a venture capital corporation.</p><p>His writings bridge the topics of self-help and finance, and focus on creating and generating personal wealth and happiness through deeper self-honesty. His perspective on business differs distinctly from other titles in the \"self-help\" or \"finance\" genre in both Japanese and American publications. He provides ongoing support to people who want to change their lives by offing mentoring programs, therapeutic healing workshops, business seminars, and correspondence courses.&nbsp;</p><p>“You don't have to be super wealthy to be happy, because happiness happens in the moment,” says Ken. “Once you appreciate your money, you start appreciating your family, what you have, and everything in life. So, it's very Zen. Once in this state of gratitude, your life shifts, and that opens a door to a new possibility of attracting more fun things in your life. It's nothing to do with how much money you have or how much money you make.”</p><p>Ken covers established a new approach to money in his newest book—“Happy Money: The Japanese Art of Making Peace with Your Money.” So, if you want to face your fears about money, improve the relationship you have with your money and learn how generosity begets generosity, this is the podcast for you!</p>\n      ",

I will watch you breathing or whatever, and I will write an article about that,\" or you can jump in and give it an experience.”</p><p>That pique’s Dave interest more than a little, as he notes Scott’s curiosity and “willingness to go to the ends of the earth to figure out cool stuff.” Scott’s curiosity gets a boost from learning “neural grammar,” which allows better control of the parasympathetic nervous system. Because our system craves homeostasis, he says, it’s going to find it naturally because of the environmental stimulus to which you’re being exposed.</p><p>Listen in on this conversation about human endurance, why effortless comfort is hindering our health and how “the wedge” can flip your neurological script.</p>\n      ",

Only 20% of our digestive system is devoted to fermentation. We have a hydrochloric acid base digestive system. We are designed to derive nutrients from animals that have synthesized these nutrients for us.

Cody is a physicist turned first-generation farmer turned founder and CEO of Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative.</p><p>He has spent more than a dozen years developing a vertically integrated sustainable livestock farm with an unwavering vision of creating a farming business that is good for the animals, good for the environment and good for customers.</p><p>Cody and his wife, Andrea Todt, established Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative in 2014, with their own Falling Sky Farm in Arkansas as one of the founding farms. Grass Roots is a collective partnership of more than 20 small farms across the U.S—in places such as Oregon, Nevada, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, and North Carolina—fostering respectful farming practices and love for the land.</p><p>“Grass Roots Cooperative is on a mission to change the way meat is produced and consumed in this country,” Cody says. “Healthy animals raised outdoors with sunlight, fresh air, and clean grass—no hormones, antibiotics, or GMOs needed.”</p><p>The goal is to reach 100 farms over the next three years.</p><p>Farms in the cooperative follow a single set of the highest quality standards with a focus on five priorities:</p><ul><li>Health &amp; Nutrition</li><li>Sustainability</li><li>Farmer to You</li><li>Butchered by Hand</li><li>Transparency</li></ul><p>“As customers are demanding more and more transparency and higher and higher quality meat that's healthier for them, where the animals are treated better, it's creating a whole new opportunity for farmers,” Cody says. “We’re always looking for those symbiotic relationships, where you're putting an animal in an environment that it's evolved to live in, versus trying to force them into some other system.”</p><p>The outcome? A naturally balanced ecosystem, soil regeneration and productive pastures.</p><p>Grass Roots’ aim is to provide the best quality and most nutritious meat in a manner that is humane, transparent, sustainable and fair.&nbsp;Its farms are the first in the United States to use blockchain technology to trace their products from farm to fork. This allows customers to be confident in the origin and quality of the meat they buy.&nbsp;Grass Roots also has an open-farm policy and is completely transparent at every stage.</p><p>“Let's focus on supporting small scale farmers that are doing this right,” Cody says. “That really is what it comes back to for me, being able to connect with those small farmers, support them, and let the customers vote with their dollar on the kind of food system they want to support.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>And that, says Dave, is “actually how food is supposed to work.”</p>\n      ",

            "description": "\n        <p>In this intriguing episode of Bulletproof Radio, Dave welcomes Anil Seth, a leading researcher, writer, and public speaker on consciousness science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Anil has broad experience communicating new ideas from the forefront of research in these areas, which confront some of humanity’s greatest questions and challenges.</p><p>In his work, Anil seeks to understand the biological basis of consciousness by bringing together research across neuroscience, mathematics, artificial intelligence, computer science, psychology, philosophy and psychiatry. He’s currently a professor of <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sussexneuroscience/research/cognition\" target=\"_blank\">Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex</a> and founding co-director of the <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/\" target=\"_blank\">Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science</a>.</p><p>As well as pioneering this interdisciplinary approach, Anil is recognized for his influential theories about how conscious experiences of the world and self are (distinct) forms of ‘controlled hallucinations.’ His TEDtalk “<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/anil_seth_how_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality\" target=\"_blank\">How Your Brain Hallucinates Your Conscious Reality</a>” has been viewed nearly 7.4M&nbsp;million times.</p><p>This episode will up-end what you think about perception and reality—and how much, or little, control, we really have. Here’s a sneak peek at the conversation:</p><p><strong>About Perception</strong></p><ul><li>“Perception doesn't come from the outside in. It really goes the other direction. It comes from the inside out.”</li><li>“The purpose of perception is not to figure out objectively what's out there in the world. The purpose of perception is to enable our adaptive behavior.”</li><li>“We need to develop ways of training our perception.”</li></ul><p><strong>About Sensory Experience</strong></p><ul><li>“Language carves up the sensory world in some more bits.”</li><li>“The same things in your brain are happening when you're having a hallucination, perceiving something that other people don't, as when you engage in normal perception. It's just some aspects of the balance has changed.”</li><li>“As humans, we don't just passively experience a stream of sensory information. We're always actively sampling our worlds.”</li></ul><p><br></p>\n      ",

            "description": "\n        <p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, you’ll find out how interpersonal neurobiology looks at the vital connections among:</p><ul><li>Our mind;</li><li>Our embodied brain (meaning the functions of our body, biochemical functions, physiological functions, neural functions); and</li><li>Our relationships (with other people, with nature, with the planet).</li></ul><p><br></p><p>These, say Dr. Dan Siegel, “form the foundation for how we try to understand what life on Earth is about, what human life is, and how we can try to direct it in a way that supports well-being.” Putting identity, attachment, and survival together literally shapes the health of your body.</p><p>Dr. Siegel comes to Bulletproof Radio fresh off the stage at the 6th Annual Biohacking Conference at the Beverly Hilton where he gave an exceptional presentation on the science and practice of presence. For more than two decades, he’s taught clinical psychiatry at UCLA and is a best-selling author and co-author of more than a dozen books. He’s the founding co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/\" target=\"_blank\">UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center</a>&nbsp;and the founder and executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.mindsightinstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mindsight Institute</a>, as well as the medical director of the <a href=\"https://lifespanlearn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lifespan Learning Institute</a>, and the founding editor of the <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/book-template.aspx?ser=Norton+Series+on+Interpersonal+Neurobiology&amp;currentpage=1&amp;lastpage=4\" target=\"_blank\">Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology</a>.</p><p>The particular field of neurobiology he discusses with Dave is dedicated to understanding the brain, subjective experience, and the ways in which the brain is altered by experience. It stays grounded in science but not limited to what any given scientific field suggests, he explains. “We try to combine all the fields of science, from math and physics all the way to sociology and anthropology, into one framework.”</p><p>Two established realms of physics, Newtonian and Quantum, get a lot of attention in today’s show. Nine domains of integration do, too. Why? In a nutshell, we need to stop being isolated nouns and start being interconnected verbs. That’s the only way we’ll reach optimal health. And three pillars—focused attention, opened awareness, and kind intention—actually slow aging. Research proves it.</p><p>As with life and biohacking, “When things are going well, they're in a state of harmony,” says Dr. Siegel. “When things aren't going well, they're either in chaos or rigidity or some combination of both.”</p><p>In today’s far-reaching conversation, the science of the mind meets the science of the body. Take a listen to find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.drdansiegel.com/resources/wheel_of_awareness/\" target=\"_blank\">Wheel of Awareness</a> and how to live, lead, love and learn from the Plane of Possibility.</p>\n      ",

We’re welcoming Ian Mitchell back to the show to talk about his exciting new patent that could have important implications for human cancer treatments.</p><p>Who knew that reconfiguration of the carbon atom or molecule could have such profound effects on cellular activity? Ian did. As the vice president of Research at C360 Health, his focus is on using natural products to impact a wide range of health issues and on innovative health supplementation through the use of LipoFullerenes™.</p><p>He and his team have been researching and developing supplements and therapeutics using Carbon nanoparticulate as a backbone for complexed molecules and solutions—things ranging from joint renewal, to hair regrowth to anti-metastatic therapies for cancer. A&nbsp;fullerene&nbsp;is a molecule of carbon in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes. A fullerene dissolved in olive oil has anti-aging, anti-wrinkle, anti-pollution, skin brightening/lightening, hair growth-stimulation, anti-inflammatory, pore-tightening efficacy. It also helps with the improvement of the skin barrier and acne. Dissolved in coconut oil, it is beneficial for your eyes.</p><p>Ian’s team discovered that LipoFullerenes™ up-regulate mitochondrial function at the same time they decrease inflammation. Specifically, cellular enhancements in biological systems through the use of LipoFullerenes™ and peptide group combinations. And their newest research is even more profound: “We've developed something that does, in fact, entirely inhibit metastatic behavior of cancer,” Ian says. “That's pretty cool.”</p><p>LipoFullerenes™ used on a daily basis play a big part in cellular health, as well as a ketogenic diet. “That's the apex of the whole thing,” he says. “Get on a keto diet. Just stop feeding the problem.”</p><p>So if you want to learn how to enhance your cellular function and put your body back in line so that your immune system can do what it’s supposed to do, we invite you to listen to today’s episode.</p>\n      ",

She’s currently one of the only spine surgeons in the country to offer stem cell treatments using a patient’s own harvested cells to promote healing.</p><p>Listeners may remember that she was the third set of six hands during Dave’s whole-body stem cell makeover. (For those new to the show, more on that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bulletproof.com/harry-adelson-amy-killen-578/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bulletproof.com/what-are-stem-cells-types-27-03-19/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.) In today’s episode, Dr. Marcella describes—in detail—what she did with stem cells along Dave’s spine. She also makes exosomes fun: “They are little nanoparticles full of awesome, regenerative juice,” she says.</p><p>Understanding and treating spinal disease is the focus of Dr. Marcella’s professional medical practice. She approaches that work by combining surgical and holistic perspectives. Her expertise comes from rigorous training and background, including a Johns Hopkins fellowship, as well as extensive travel throughout Europe and the U.S. to learn progressive techniques and regenerative medicine practices.</p><p>Today’s conversation also pivots into preparing patients for surgery and caring for them afterward in ways that are unconventional, and this is where Dr. Marcella’s integrative approach really shines. She addresses sleep, inflammation, nutrition, movement, stress management, and energy modalities for pain management—not just the nitty gritty of the surgical procedure.</p><p>You’ll be captivated by Dr. Marcella’s viewpoint:&nbsp;“We're on the verge in the next 20-50 years of having a totally different understanding of the biology of the body,” she says. “I think that's where we're going—figuring out how to use external energy plus regenerative medicine together.”</p>\n      ",

But in the beginning, he spent several years sitting in uncomfortable positions with whirling thoughts and feeling like he was failing at meditation. He couldn’t settle his body or his mind.</p><p>He had to find his own sweet spot of comfort: “When I did that, it completely upgraded the quality of my experiences, and that's where I first had the tangible experience of bliss,” he says. And you can, too.

She wants people to become their own food gurus and ask: “If I have this symptom, what do I need to modify? Is there a digestive enzyme that I need to take? Or is there a nutrient that can really up-level my response to nutrition?” Our conversation also touches on adaptive physiology, food sensitivities, mold and essential self-care.</p><p>She believes food can be a powerful ally in your healing journey. “My goal is to establish a communication pathway for people between their bodies and the things that they're ingesting,” she says.</p><p>As a patient advocate, researcher, clinician, educator and also a best-selling author of two previous books and a new one publishing in March, she is committed to raising awareness on how to overcome autoimmune thyroid disease, how to use food as medicine, and how to manage the stresses and toxins in our everyday environments.</p><p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n      ",

He's well-known for earning the trust of some of the most guarded and secretive celebrities in the world.</p><p>His life has been enthralling and complex: Remarkably insightful interviews with celebrities and musicians, award-winning journalism, successful authorship and ghostwriting, becoming a pick-up artist, reforming himself and his relationships, becoming a parent and hosting programs focused on healing trauma and transforming lives.</p><p>In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, we talk about facing fears, discomfort and anxieties—how to tell the difference among them and what we get wrong about them. That leads us to a cognitive bias called the neglect of probability. As you may know, running from failure versus moving towards success is a very different mindset.</p><p>Neil shares his fascination with how beliefs get implanted and reinforced, and offers up a theory as to why so many people go off track when they're working on finding their passion and purpose. He says, “Do something you love enough that you care about each detail of it.” And that’s our cue to share some highlights of his intriguing new podcast—will it be called “’Gonzo?!”—that debuts this month. </p><p>Enjoy the show!</p><p>More about Neil Strauss</p><p>In addition to being an author of The Game, The Truth, Emergency and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Nlu3Rf\" target=\"_blank\">other books</a> about his own personal experiences, he’s a respected and sought-after ghostwriter. He has co-authored numerous books, such as Jenna Jameson's <em>How to Make Love Like a Porn Star</em>; Mötley Crue’s, <em>The Dirt</em> (currently being produced by Netflix as a theatrical film); Marilyn Manson's <em>The Long Hard Road</em>; and Dave Navarro's <em>Don't Try This at Home</em>.

We also dove into a detailed conversations about liver meat, fertility issues on a vegan diet, how to stay Bulletproof when traveling with family, and how to nourish your kids the best way possible.\nIn 2005, Kristen walked away from her corporate career in executive-level operations to focus on her true passion: healthy food. Already a vegan for two years, she turned her attention to the raw vegan cuisine and lifestyle, initially teaching classes and providing personal chef services, but as her online audience grew, she ultimately shifted to full-time blogging, recipe development, and eventually publishing 12 books on raw vegan diets. By 2012, concerns with her and her child's health forced her to reevaluate the nutritional claims made by advocates of raw and vegan diets.\n    \nAfter Kristen introduced high quality animal products into her family's diet, she saw dramatic improvements almost immediately. Her family now eats a diet high in grass-fed beef and butter, bison, pastured eggs, and wild-caught seafood, while avoiding grains, gluten, and soy. While her personal transformation and conversion from vegan to omnivore has been controversial in the vegan and raw food community, Kristen has been on hiatus from blogging to spend time researching and fully exploring the nutritional and culinary aspects of eating in this new way for her family.\n      ",

Ronda is putting her more than 25 years of experience in high tech to work at SweetWater Health™, where they are looking at the signal coming from the human heart, and instead of seeing beats per minute or simple heart rate variability, seeing a huge pool of big data just waiting to be analyzed using Ronda’s crazy advanced math skills.

            "description": "\n        Dr. Sara Gottfried is a Harvard doc, biohacker, and yoga-powered champion of your health, happiness and hormonal equilibrium. She’s also seen 20,000 patients in the past 20 years and applied her training as a MIT bioengineer to how women and men can leverage the upstream and downstream mediators to create natural hormone balance with next gen medicine, and wrote a book about it, called The Hormone Cure: Reclaim Balance, Sleep, Sex Drive, and Vitality Naturally with The Gottfried Protocol (Simon & Schuster, 3/12/13)\nShe biohacked her own happy hormones and happy brain chemicals as a 30-something stress case battling McMedicine, PMS, and low sex drive. She was offered Prozac and a birth control pill for her misery by her primary care physician, and that was a defining moment that allowed her to step from her darkest hour into the grace of biohacking bliss. The main culprit: CORTISOL. It took her 4 weeks to get her crazy-high cortisol down to the Goldilocks position of not too high and not too low, and she applied that learning and refined her protocol on her next 10,000 patients over the next 10 years. Results were staggering: Dr. Sara could neutralize cortisol, what she calls the “bad-boyfriend” hormone in 1 minute. She reversed insulin resistance in 48 hours. She got estrogen back into it’s rightful place, and thyroid, inside of 2 weeks.\nShe believes knowledge is power, science is sexy... and, oh yes, actionable needle-moving solutions are hot. Listen in for our dialogue about cutting-edge science, and crazy-lovin’ solutions -- for men and women.\n      ",
