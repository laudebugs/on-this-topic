April owned and operated her own private holistic healing and counseling practice, and agreed to be interviewed for the project. Bringing her expertise and connections to the film, it was clear this was going to be a powerful partnership beyond the interview. April came on as a producer on the film series, the pair started gaining momentum for their eye-opening project, and Path 11 Productions was born.

In 2011, he deployed as a trauma surgeon to Afghanistan's Helmand and Nimroz provinces in support of OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM with II Marine Expeditionary Forces. He has supported special joint forces missions to South America, the Middle East, the South Pacific, Australia, and Africa. He earned both the Surface Warfare Medical Department Officer and Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officer designations, and his military honors include two Meritorious Service Medals and the Joint Service Commendation Medal. \r\n\r\nOn his life-threatening missions, he discovered that survival has more to do with the health of the spirit than it does with the physical vehicle that carries it. \r\n\r\nToday he's a best-selling author of four books, including 'Gifts of the Heart,' 'Star Patrol,' 'Seven Pillars of Life,' and 'The Art of Human Care' and inspires audiences' stories from two decades working on the fringe of life & death. \r\n\r\nOf all the missions he has been on, the most important one is to impact a billion people to advance their mind, body, & spirit in every area of their life.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

I am a full time medical/pharmaceutical sales representative and in 2018, I “came out” as a medium. Being raised Catholic and then \"saved\" in high school, being a medium was not something I believed in or even thought was real or okay with God. After many awesome experiences and taking a step back and re-examining everything I was ever taught or believed in, I discovered some profound insight on life.\r\n\r\nAs a medium, I pride myself on being a man of God, serving God, and I use my gifts from Him to help others. I just published my book called “Why Are We Here”.

It was during this time Het-Heru, also a spiritual intuitive, began using her clairaudient abilities to connect with her spiritual guides whom she calls the 'Ancestors'.

She will explain how her tribal Laos-Hmong heritage going further back into Lemurian-Buddhist folklores about our ancient times can help with our transition into the galactic Golden Age of Humanity through the path of awakening and ascension. However, she spent the last 20 years compiling scientific research through following the collaboration between Buddhist monks and academic research institutions to explain how all sacred geometry is Buddhist mandalas. In her book, “Buddhist Mandalas: Explore Parallel Realities with Sacred Geometry”, she will explain how people can explore parallel realities using a 5th dimensional level of consciousness through the study of sacred geometry. https://merkabachakras.com/ \r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "Award winning writer Maia Toll has been many things— a horseback riding teacher, a clinical herbalist, and (oddly) a university professor— but by far her favorite title is author. Her best-selling Wild Wisdom series (The Illustrated Herbiary,The Illustrated Bestiary, & The Illustrated Crystallary) offers a glimpse into the knowings of the natural world and the wilds within ourselves. Maia contemplated these insights during her yearlong apprenticeship to a traditional healer in Ireland. When not obsessively reading books and “talking” to trees, stones, and her two dogs, Maia drinks copious amounts of tea and helps run Herbiary, a multi-city natural wellness and sacred living store. maiatoll.com \r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "Miguel Dean walks the path of the sacred masculine. He is a writer and author of his latest book Bring Him Home – A Twin Flame Love Story. He was born in 1968 in Colchester, England where he had a difficult start to life which included the death of his mother from cancer when he was only seven months old. As a result of his child hood traumas, his early years were troubled. This was the beginning of a beautiful and at times extremely challenging 22-year journey to return to healing and wholeness. Miguel has now evolved into a profoundly effective catalyst for change in the marriage of the divine twin flame masculine and feminine within adults. His writing and one to one sessions are all in alignment with his passion to serve and ease the transition, from what no longer serves humanity and the planet, into a more beautiful world for our children and the generations to come.

Sara has been on a path of self-inquiry since age 17, when she first began to meditate and search for healing. In spite of her efforts, Sara continued to struggle and lived with chronic depression for another fifteen years. After finding yoga in her late twenties and establishing a regular practice, Sara’s energetic body and consciousness began to awaken. This shift led to the lifting of her depression and for this reason she has dedicated her life to sharing her practice.\r\n\r\nFor the past seven years Sara has been the owner of Yoga Nest Venice, where she teaches regularly. Sara feels that it is not enough to heal oneself, but rather, she sees that our self-healing is simply the foundation for our soul’s work and that living a life of service by sharing our gifts is key to living a joyful life and to experiencing true liberation. http://yoganestvenice.com\r\n\r\n_____________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "Mark Gober, a partner in a Silicon Valley investment bank and strategy firm, has been drawn to life's big questions starting from his years as a Princeton undergrad. Physics--particularly astrophysics fascinated him, but he was too far into his economic major and other obligations to make the switch. As a compromise, instead of studying the invisible forces that govern the universe, he elected to study the invisible forces that govern human judgment and decision making--psychology/behavioral economics. But these big existence questions continued to plague him until he began the research which converted him from a \"materialist\" and ultimately propelled him to write the book--for every other hard core \"materialist\" still out there. www.MarkGober.com\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "The hero's journey monomyth is at the core of stories worldwide among indigenous peoples, the ancients, and our modern society. Before Orion: Finding the Face of the Hero — explores a deeper root for this monomyth by looking at how hunter-gatherers viewed themselves within the natural and spiritual worlds through Paleolithic cave art from 40,000 years ago. Biological Time author and naturalist Bernie Taylor proposes that select cave paintings are fundamental pieces in the human journey to self-realization, the foundation of written language, and a record of biological knowledge that irrevocably impacted some of the artistic styles, religious practices, and stories that are still with us. Taylor addresses a profound archaeological elephant in the room by opening up an uncharted place in our history, which points to the cultural ancestors of mankind.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

Before Orion: Finding the Face of the Hero — explores a deeper root for this monomyth by looking at how hunter-gatherers viewed themselves within the natural and spiritual worlds through Paleolithic cave art from 40,000 years ago. Biological Time author and naturalist Bernie Taylor proposes that select cave paintings are fundamental pieces in the human journey to self-realization, the foundation of written language, and a record of biological knowledge that irrevocably impacted some of the artistic styles, religious practices, and stories that are still with us. Taylor addresses a profound archaeological elephant in the room by opening up an uncharted place in our history, which points to the cultural ancestors of mankind. www.berforeorion.com\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "Just listening and feeling the sensations in our Abdomen/ Belly makes us more conscious and aware. We hold so much in our Belly so that it can become rock hard and like an onion it requires peeling the never ending layers. I have found that my way of communicating and helping others is by offering Abdominal Massage it can help others become aware and listen to the still small voice inside. \r\n\r\nI have been a massage practitioner for 20 years, and specialise  in Abdominal-Sacral massage. The abdomen is so often ignored and is an area that is least touched. Now Scientists call the guts “the second brain”! With more neurone endings than the brain. The massage works on both the sacral area and your abdomen from just under your ribs down towards your pubic bone. Although it is a great massage for both men and women, for women it has the added bonus of releasing any muscular/fascial restrictions in the abdomen that maybe affecting your uterus and ovaries. It is a great way to get in touch with your belly!!\"\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "Deirdre Hade began to see energy at a very early age. Deirdre’s work has expanded into the development of a system of spiritual awakening and healing based on her depth of experience in the Kabbalah’s Tree of Life. Her life’s work, The Radiance Journey, is an energetic practice of meditation and mindfulness on the qualities of divine light for transpersonal growth. William Arntz started his professional career as a research laser physicist, working on “Star Wars” high energy lasers. He then moved on to software, writing “AutoSys”–an automated job control system currently in use by most Fortune 500 companies. He sold that company, retired, but then decided to make a film: creating, producing and directing What the BLEEP Do We Know!?, an exploration of spirituality, quantum physics, neurology and outrageous possibilities. The film and the companion book, with editions in over twenty languages, were international hits. http://BookofSurprises.com/\r\n\r\n ________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

This is an initiatory time and one that will be played out via \"Harmony Through Conflict”\r\n\r\nUnderstand what is happening in the “Converging Flow” and why we are in the “Rude Awakening” in the Awakenings Process for Soul Alignment.\r\n\r\nIt all ties in and all makes sense from an esoteric, spiritualist and metaphysical point of view… It is a great time for great care, deeper understanding… Time to take some chances, to risk being seen and heard… It is also a time to check motivations, intentions…\r\n\r\nThere will be more Soul – Solar Power for each person….It is a time to understand the difference between over powered and underpowered and move into power that is empowerment.\r\n\r\nIt is a time for awakening to our true expression beyond the ego and cult of personality to soul alignment and soul expression.\r\n",

He describes it as “a starting point that allowed me to explore life to the fullest and led me to meet my Soulmate and a personalized form of the Universe and even Satan.” He pursued a life without limits, exploring love, exposing himself to vulnerability, holding onto spirituality and uses his writing to fight for the ideal of truth while battling societal hypocrisies.\r\n\r\nGregor’s book exposes the essential nature of courage by following his radically honest and deeply spiritual reflections.  The lessons he shares reveal a wise framework for liberating oneself from the claws of fear of not being accepted and embracing personal growth, authentic sex, happiness and self-love. \r\n\r\n ________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

Through her readings, she brings back missing ingredients, lost family recipes, joyous meal-time memories from the other side, and memories that need to be revisited for therapeutic reasons. She can even connect with spirit guides who offer insight on what foods are needed to balance your Chakra energy system.\r\n\r\nwww.ClairvoyantGourmet.com\r\n\r\n ________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

She understands how everyday self-neglect or abuse and a sense of feeling divorced from yourself is all too often an everyday acceptable behavior for way too many people.  She shares with you how to climb up from self-neglect and into sagacious selfishness so you can learn how to love, honor, and cherish yourself forever after.  After 22+ years of medical practice and over 100,000 patient visits Dr. Bowlin has found the missing link that will help you propel yourself into personal excellence mentally, physically, and spiritually. www.JulaBowlinMD.com\r\n\r\n ________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "In 2000, while working as a National Ski Patroller in Southern California, Heyes sustained a massive spinal cord injury from which he was initially paralyzed from the neck down, unable to move, feel, or breathe.  The story of his remarkable healing has received widespread attention since its publication in “Chicken Soup for the Soul ~ A Book of Miracles: Miracle on the Mountain.” That experience, which Heyes shares in gripping detail in “THE TOUCH,” awakened him to his own healing gifts and set the stage for his total immersion in the healing arts – a journey which took him through a lineage of masters and teachers from various traditions, and back to school, where he graduated with Master’s Degree in Spiritual Psychology. Heyes has devoted himself to developing his private practice in Spiritual Psychology, Transformational Coaching and RAM Healing.  He has also created an intensive workshop – “AWAKEN YOUR INNER HEALER” – in which he teaches the skills presented in THE TOUCH. www.dougheyeshealing.com\r\n\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nAwakenings With Michele Meiche is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.

            "description": "Carl Johan Calleman started his career in the hard sciences and has a PhD in Physical Biology from the University of Stockholm. He has written highly quoted papers in the fields of environmental science, toxicology and cancer research and has given lectures among other places at the MIT, Cornell, The Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and the World Health Organization. In 1994 he however devoted himself full time to understanding the Mayan calendar and has been working on this ever since. He has published four books based on this calendar and helped the Mayan elders spread their message in the world. Through this he has become known as the main proponent of the idea that the Mayan calendar is about the evolution of consciousness rather than astronomical phenomena. His most recent book is The Global Mind and the Rise of Civilization. www.calleman.com\r\n\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nThe Awakenings Radio Show is Your place for tips and insight to live a more fulfilling life, and your relationships.
