With original poetry by Minerva Lerner and original song by Edward Harris. Produced and edited by Sara Harris.\n\nHear in the City’s Sara Harris and Minerva Lerner delve into old audio recordings documenting the voice of Sara's father and the fluidity of time over 10 years living with -and through- Alzheimers in a multi-generational household. This, in honour of Edward Samuel Harris (02/18/1930-03/30/2018).\n\n(Featuring Minerva Lerner, Sara Harris, Amanda Harris, Edward Harris, and the sounds of homes they have lived in.)",

On this episode of Hear in the City, we sit in on the panel discussion with iconic playwright and director, Luis Valdez, academy-award-nominee Edward James Olmos, and long-time film and television actor, Rose Portillo as they screen the film that changed all of their careers when it made its way -as a play- to Broadway in New York City in 1978.\r\n",

Access to the forest is open for the first time since the fires-- in selected areas.\r\nAnd vanguard moving image arts organization L.A. Freewaves is on the move on MTA buses all across Los Angeles County. We talk to executive director, Anne Bray, about the collaboration between Public Matters, The Echo Park Film Center, UCLA REMAP, and L.A. Freewaves to take over the Transit T.V. screens on 2,200 buses for the week of June 13th-June 19th with original place-based video and film projects made by youth in Los Angeles.",

We hear from writer Steven Reigns with a tribute to gay love and acceptance and from writer/performer Gabriela Garcia Medina with a poem about empowerment over pervasive pop music messages that try to keep a woman down.

            "description": "Los Angeles has had an unusual amount of precipitation in resent weeks yet, the watershed of the city loses 70% of that water because it is channeled directly to the ocean. This is a fundamental part of city history. The reason for it dates back to decisions made in the 1930’s to channel the Los Angeles River in order to avoid floods. But, the L.A. River is a meandering body of water that can be powerful in times of generous rain and anemic in the summer. \r\n\r\nNow, almost 85% of the water we use in the City of Los Angeles is imported from the Colorado River and from Northern California. But, what if we could capture and save the water that falls from the sky in quantity as it has in the past few weeks so as not to take water from other places that need it, too? \r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Department of Public Works has been working hard on that question.  In collaboration with dozens of national and local non-profits ranging from the Natural Resources Defense Council and Heal the Bay, the City of Los Angeles has been changing the landscape and helping Los Angeles residents to collect rain water from heavy rains so that it can be stored for use during dry months.  \r\n\r\nHear in the City's host, Sara Harris spoke with Department of Public Works Director of Stormwater Management, Shahram Kharaghani--She asked him the following question: what do could we ideally do with all that rain water?\r\n\r\n(c) Hear In The City. 2011 . www.hearinthecity.org\r\n\r\nAirs Mondays on KPFK 90.7FM in Los Angeles at 2:00pm or www.kpfk.org   ",

            "description": "David Alfaro Siquieros is known as one of “Los Tres Grandes” the three major Mexican muralists who depicted and helped define national and international images of post-revolutionary Mexico.  In 1932, after having served prison time for his political views, Siquieros came to Los Angeles to work. \r\n\r\nThe artist had mastered an outdoor mural technique with a workers’ rights painting at the Choinard Art School. That piece, called “Street Meeting” was painted over, white washed for its socialist content. \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Siquieros was commissioned by patron of the arts F.K Firenz and wealthy city booster Christine Sterling to paint a mural on a  beer garden wall above the Italian Hall at Olvera Street. That mural -titled America Tropical- figures prominently in Los Angeles art history, in no small part because it was whitewashed shortly after it was completed. \r\n\r\nAmerica Tropical sits at the center of an exhibition currently on display at the Autry Musuem called Siquieros in Los Angeles: Censorship Defied. Hear in the City host, Sara Harris took a tour with the curators of the show, Lynn Labate and Luis C. Garza to talk about the circumstances around the creating and subsequent covering up of that mural.\r\n\r\n(c) Hear In The City. 2011 . www.hearinthecity.org\r\n\r\nAirs Mondays on KPFK 90.7FM in Los Angeles at 2:00pm or www.kpfk.org",

            "description": "“Art in the Streets” is set to debut in April of this year at the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (MOCA).  This show is planned to be a comprehensive statement on international street art, cholo graffiti art, tattoo art, and skater art from the 1970’s to the present moment.  The exhibition has already drawn attention in artists’ circles and in international press prior to the scheduled opening, primarily because of the whitewashing of one of its commissioned works.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the “Art in the Streets” exhibition, the Italian street artist known as BLU was hired by MOCA to paint a mural on the north wall of the Geffen Temporary Contemporary in Little Tokyo. The images of coffins draped in dollar bills- a direct commentary on the U.S. Defense Department’s refusal to allow photography of soldiers’ coffins returning from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \r\n\r\nThe museum had the mural was removed just after its completion. \tNew museum director Jeffrey Deitch explained to the Los Angeles Times that the work could be seen as offensive by other members of the Little Tokyo community that is home to a Japanese-American veterans war memorial and to the Veterans Affairs hospital.\r\nWe wanted to get a sense of how street art and white-washing continue to affect local artists in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nHear In The City Producer Luis Sierra Campos, spoke with Alex Poli, who goes by the name of MANONE, and who directs CREWEST Gallery in Downtown LA. MANONE was instrumental in organizing a permitted 10,000 square foot graffiti mural on the Los Angeles River in 2008. The mural was later ordered whitewashed by county supervisor Gloria Molina.\r\n\r\n(c) Hear In The City. 2011 . www.hearinthecity.org.

If you listen regularly (we thank you) and you’ve probably noticed that our show focuses on environment, arts, education, and culture in and around Los Angeles.  Most of the stories you’ll hear today, as we wrap up the year, have to do with the economy--Why? \r\n\r\nWell, we’ve been thinking a lot about what this show should do.  What do we need in Southern California that a little radio show with a lot of voices can provide? We landed on this: community and equality in the urban environment.  \r\n\r\nOur goal with Hear in the City is to map the city through sound-rich profiles of people living and working toward creative social change and solutions. One way we do that, as journalists and producers, is working with community stakeholders who have important stories to tell.\r\n\r\nHear in the City: Radio Realities from the Urban Landscape hosted by Sara Harris http://www.hearinthecity.org",

It was heartbreaking, and I was angry and bitter. I was also very moved by the strength, resourcefulness and resilient spirit of many of the people struggling to survive in whatever ways they could. So I asked everyone I met to sing \"America the Beautiful\" because it was a song I loved and seemed to represent all that was unattainable and long, long forgotten for the people I was meeting.”\r\n\r\n(c) Hear in the City. 2010. www.hearinthecity.org.

Many of those murals have been defaced over the years by taggers and by graffiti artists. As a result graffiti has a pretty bad name in the city. Each year, 34 million tax dollars go toward eradicating grafitti.
