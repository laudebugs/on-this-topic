She founded Free Birth Society prior to the conscious conception of her first child, and went on to give birth to her daughter freely, on Maui, Hawaii.Emilee’s acclaimed podcast (“The Free Birth Society Podcast”) quickly became a fan favorite and has reached millions of people.The Free Birth Society private membership has become a bastion of birth freedom, truth, and community, in a world in which women’s birth choices are increasingly curtailed.

Ph.D. They first came through Ginger in 1988 and went public in 1994, activating their Mission through private sessions and public seminars. \r\n\r\nSince then, they illuminated and supported people in their personal evolution so that they could take advantage of the Great Consciousness Shift that was kicked off in 2012 and that came to a pivotal evolutionary point in 2018. \r\n\r\nTheir Mission has been to use the new consciousness energies coming in from the Light Future to teach people how to craft and manifest their own personal New Life in their own New World on a template of Love and Empowerment, Freedom, and Trust of/Reliance upon their Spiritual Team. \r\n\r\nBut there's more. There is a greater Mission for us all that Galexis is helping us with, and that includes dreaming this New World for everyone, thus participating in the world's evolution as well. The goal is the Aquarian Age principle of the individual remaining distinct and luminous sharing radiance into the Collective and belonging in the Oneness of all beings.\r\n\r\nAbout the channel, Ginger Metraux Ph.D. Ginger has been an astrologer, life coach, writer, and nutritionist before becoming a trance channel.

Celia is known as the \"Everyday Goddess\" with rusty red locks and twinkling eyes which cast a spell of enchantment upon her listeners. Celia gifts those in her audience with a warm, deep and resonating experience touching your heart, your skin, your whole being. \r\n\r\n\tIn addition to having the kind of silky smooth voice often associated with classic Celtic Singers, such as \"Celtic Woman\", Celia excels at comedy. She often transforms right on stage into one or more of her alter-egos-whose antics typically leave the audience howling with laughter. With powerful, heart-felt vocals and wacky comedic improvisations, the audience never knows what will happen with Celia on stage.\r\n\t \r\n\tCelia has opened for notable authors: Marianne Williamson, Dr. Masaru Emoto, Susun Weed, Donna Eden, and Swami Beyondanonda (aka Steve Berhman), provided live music for the Off-Broadway production of \"Rum & Vodka, & has received a \"Best Storytelling CD\" nomination for \"Irish Tales\" by the International Just Plain Folks Awards (The Grassroots of Grammies).

She also demystifies traditional practices that hold overlays unnecessary to our current times, bringing essential skills and inner navigation tools to help us all reconnect to our planet and embody our capacities as conscious co-creative beings. \r\n\r\nIn her individual session work with people, Cristina serves as an oracle, open and receptive to higher aspects of consciousness delivering what is transmitted.

Pegi's research has uncovered improved strategies for intercultural competency with Turtle Island First Nations through social justice solidarity, anti-oppression work, allyship and reconciliation.  And as the paradigm shifts today to earth-connected sustainable community, in a fascinating twist Ancient Spirit Rising re-frames the Pagan and Goddess Spirituality movements as a response to the directive from Indigenous Elders to recover our own ancestral wisdom. From the wealth of resources available today, we can restore our ecocentric worldview and find an authentic self-identity from our own heritages in Old Europe, using the timeless values of Indigenous mind as our model.  Come back to your roots! \r\n\r\n\r\n\tthis episode Q&A includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• irregular menstrual cycle..\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• any comfrey grown from seed is not safe for internal consumption..\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• hypericum perforatum grows well from seed..\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• is drinking vinegar good for people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• insomnia- screen time, warm milk with cocao, soporific herbs..\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• preparing the body for surgery..\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• it is impossible to make mistakes..\r\n\r\n\r\n\t• is this menopause? \r\n\r\n\r\n\t• and much more...\r\n",

From a very young age, Barbara Grace was a midwife. “Innately I knew that the power of touch and being a quiet witness could heal and calm.  At births with all species, and in all situations.”\r\n\r\nGraduating from seminary school at 19, Rev. Grace went on to speak all over North America about hands on healing and developing our own innate intuition. Then in the late ‘70’s she began her apprentice training with a traditional midwife, to become a midwife herself.  Always a change-maker in the often oppositional worlds of our personal human rights and the laws of the legal system, she has consistently made a stand for choice, even when she became an ‘outlaw’ in the process!\r\n\r\nRev. Grace is mom to 3 grown sons and “Morai” (Irish for ‘grandmother’) to 6 grand-darlings. A life-long advocate of gentle birthing and human rights in childbirth, she has now created the Elder Midwife History Gathering project.
