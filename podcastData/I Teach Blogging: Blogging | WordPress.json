In today's podcast I am going to share with a process to get a blog post done. The key factor here is to have a process and provide yourself with plenty of time. Blogging takes time, so be prepared for that up front. This process is how I tend to do it.<br /><br />What should I blog about next?<br />I am a hard-core list keeper: I create mind maps, list in Evernote and only paper that I can reach when an idea strikes. When I am ready to pick my next blog post idea, I just go to these lists and pick one. Considering the fact that I am constantly worried about running out of ideas, this step is crucial to my success.<br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

Even if we are here to entertain we are answering a question.<br /><br />It is so easy to get caught up in the tools and allow that to keep us from creating content. Perhaps this is a defense mechanism to keep us from that ever lurking fear of failure. <br /><br />If you are freaking out or worrying about whether or not you have the right font, or the right design or the right keyboard, just launch your blog. If you have stopped writing on your blog for a while and are worried about starting again, just start again. If these things are stressing you out, know that it is ok. <br /><br />Fear is normal.

This is what it is and an example of why you want to have one.<br /><br />Tips on Favicons:<br /><br />The image should be square.<br />In most cases the image needs to a .ico (icon file)<br />The size of the favicon is 16 x 16 pixels<br /><br />How to turn a png image into an ico image?<br />There is a free online conversion tool called Convertico: <a href=\"http://www.convertico.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.convertico.com/</a> The link is in the show notes.<br />There is also a tool that will convert a jpg file that I will link to in the show notes: <a href=\"http://icoconvert.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://icoconvert.com/</a><br /><br />How to add a Favicon:<br /><br />Your theme may have a way for you to easily add a Favicon, so look for that first.<br /><br />If that is not an option then you can doing a complicated ftp upload or you can use a fairly new WordPress Plugin called All in One Favicon. Currently this plugin is being run on over 200,000 sites so that is a good sign. Now if you use this plugin I want to note that you will see a warning that this plugin has not been updated in over 2 years. However, I just read some great and recent reviews on the plugin, so I would still give it a shot.

            "description": "So I ran across a tip from a new community that I joined on Facebook. It is called Screw the 9 to 5 and I wanted to share that tip here. This is a tool to help you find good places to leave blog post comments. There is a warning coming though, so be prepared.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://apple.co/1dgFZzE\" rel=\"noopener\">http://apple.co/1dgFZzE</a><br /><a href=\"http://dropmylink.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://dropmylink.com/</a><br /><br />I am not exactly sure what I think of this concept yet but I am looking into it for sure. First, let’s talk about blog post commenting. <br /><br />1. I think that blog post comments are an important part of the process. If for no other reason than supporting a blog. <br /><br />2. Can I just rant for a split second? It makes crazy that bloggers are starting to turn off their comments. I get it. I get the theory behind it and the reasoning but it still feels rude. It feel as though these bloggers who have “made it” in air quotes there b/c they have lots of money now, don’t want to hear from us or connect. They sure did when they were starting out but now I find myself visiting their blogs less and less. It just feels bad as the reader.<br /><br />Now, I know that I often wind up eating my own words. Therefore because of this rant I will probably come to you some day and tell you that I am shutting down comments. If I do please challenge me.<br /><br />3. This is the point of this tool so let’s dive into the meat of it all. The reason that I learned about this particular tool used in the way that I am about to explain has to do with an SEO technique. <br /><br />In my opinion this is a big grey and who knows how it will shake out in the future but it is related to link building. <br /><br />One of the factors that Google factors in to their algorithm is how many other sites link to your site or blog. Getting links is complicated and frankly not something that I believe should be actively pursued. <br /><br />However, I do believe in commenting on blogs. The key to blog commenting is to leave real and meaty comments. Do not just say “great post” and move on with your life. This does not add value at all. However, if you can leave an in depth comment that adds to the conversation then you are doing a great for everyone involved.<br /><br />Co schedule has an amazing community of commenters on their blog. I have found such wonderful bloggers just from their comment section alone. There can be a whole other community happening in the comments and that is just way cool.<br /><br />So why is this grey? Well, using DropMyLink, the site that I just learned about, helps you find blogs that still give back links in the comment sections. <br /><br />Google has implied to us that blog comments should be no follow, which means that you don’t get a back link for leaving a comment. Of course, we want links because they add important SEO value right?<br /><br />Well, some blogs are using old versions of commenting tools such as Comment Luv and they still give out that backlink. You can use this site to find those blogs around a certain topic such as happiness or couch surfing, ya know whatever you are in too. Then you go to those blogs and leave a lovely comment and if it is approved you will get a backlink.<br /><br />Am I going to do this? Yes, I am but only some. I will plan on a ratio such as for every 4 comments that I leave on a blog that doesn’t provide a back link, I will do one that does. This way it will not appear as though, I am suddenly trying to scam the system…ya know cheat.<br /><br />Also, I will only leave comments if I really have something of value to add. So I will leave a link to this DropMyLink.com in the show notes.<br /><br />What are you thoughts on blog post comments? Do you allow comments on your blog? Do you leave comments?<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

One of the things that I promised on this podcast is complete transparency. <br /><br />I said that I would share my successes, my struggles and my failures.<br /><br />Well lately, I have had a few struggles with my blog that I thought we could discuss. <br /><br />This is are not major issues. They are actually fairly minor but they just add up to small pains in the butt.<br /><br />#1: Social Media Icons<br />It seems that my pinterest button links to Liza Minneli’s Pinterest account. I don’t know why and it is currently still happening. Also, I can’t settle on where my social icons should display. It has been a weird thing but there ya go.<br /><br />#2: My search stopped searching<br /><br />#3: Pop Up Madness<br />This has been quite interesting to deal with. <br />1. One person complained. That is all but it still felt icky.<br />2. I didn’t have it set right for one of the popups and people weren’t getting their download.<br />3. It is a lot of working putting this all togeth er. I under estimated the amount of effort that goes into the process.<br /><br />#4: Can’t change my css<br />#5: Mic Boom arm<br />It kept falling down.<br />#6 Re-recording all of my videos<br />My sound was terrible and I had to start over. I did 4 before I figured it out and started over. Ughh<br /><br />#7: my hard drive got full<br /><br />WOW<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

Are you having trouble trying to figure out what to blog about next? Maybe you are just starting out and you just don’t quite know where to start. If this is you then this is a quick blog post idea challenge for you. By the end of this challenge, you should have a blog post written and ready to share with the world.<br /><br />Grab your favorite writing device, Evernote and a Keyboard, a white board with a marker, a napkin and pen, whatever you feel most comfortable with at this moment.<br /><br />Got it? Ready? Ok! Let’s get your blog post idea down!<br /><br />Step 1: Write a Category<br /><br />At the top of your space write out a Category that you are going to focus on today.<br /><br />Step 2: Write down the first 10 things that come to mind about that category.<br /><br />Note: This can be phrases, complete sentences, or working blog post titles. Do not write more than a sentence though.<br /><br />Step 3: Scan your your list and pick one idea.<br /><br />Great, now you have an idea and it is time to start the actual writing process. You will want to transition to your favorite word processor that you use to write your blog posts.<br /><br />Step 4: Create a bullet point list of ideas about your chosen topic.<br /><br />Step 5: Write at least 3–5 sentences about each bullet point.<br /><br />Step 6: Read what you have written and delete content and add content as you see fit. At this point you are creating paragraphs.<br /><br />Step 7: Re-read it again and edit your work.<br /><br />Step 8: Write an intro telling the reader what this post is about.<br /><br />In my opinion writing the intro is one of the most intimidating parts of writing. I have such admiration for talented writers, but the rest of us struggle with the words and getting them started. I do not want this to keep you from releasing blog posts on your blog.<br /><br />Use this intro if you are stuck<br /><br />Are you struggling to figure out ___? In this blog post I am going to share with you how to do ___.<br />I am not suggesting that this an award winning formula. However, if you have some great ideas or tips that can make a difference for your audience, I don’t want you to get hung up on the intro.<br /><br />Note: The advice that I have heard over and over again, is that if you just start writing you will get better at it. Personally, I am not sure how true this really is but I am giving it my best and I hope that you will too.<br /><br />Step 9: Write a close for your blog post.<br /><br />Tips on blog post conclusions<br /><br />Do not just end your blog post with your last point. This is your moment to summarize what you have shared.<br />Consider ending your blog post by summarizing your main point.<br />Consider challenging your reader to try what you have shared and report back.<br />Ask your readers a series of questions about your main points.<br />Step 10: Re-read your blog post for final edits.<br /><br />Now, I hope that you will take these steps and implement them for your blog. If this helped you at all to write a blog post, please send me a link to the post.<br /><br />What is your blog post writing process? Do you struggle with getting your content down? If you do, please let me know how you get your blog post done.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

The idea of this seems a bit daunting and frankly, that is partially the point. However, when people do this they see greater success. Here’s why:<br /><br />#1 Get to writing!<br /><br />Writing 20 blog posts really forces you to figure out if you can do the writing that it takes to be a blogger (or the curation). The first few blog posts are easy to write but by the time people get to blog post #11 some start to wonder if it’s worth the effort. “Is anyone paying attention?” But if you get 20 blog posts out under your chosen categories then you are probably headed in the right direction. If you can do 20 you can do 100 — remember that when you get to #57 and want to give up.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

If someone subscribes to your blog they are saying that they want to know when you release another blog post. If they fill out the subscribe information and “opt in” they will receive an email of your latest blog post.<br /><br />At this point it is up to you as to what they receive. They can receive a summary of up to however many characters that you choose or you can allow for them to see the entire blog post in their email.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

Recently, I was invited to speak at a Writer’s Conference in North East Texas. This was awesome on many levels: <br /><br />a) I get to talk about blogging<br />b) I got to talk about blogging in a small town where I spent part of my youth<br />3) I invited each attendee to spend 20 minutes with me one on one and many of them did.<br /><br />It was a long two days but it was awesome. One of the attendees was there to learn everything that he could about writing. He has a desire to write and a passion for life but he has not started the process yet. This guy is full of life and quite a character. I was immediately drawn to him because he just seems like someone who could be quite interesting to read.<br /><br />We had a one on one and I explained to him what blogging is. He had never heard of it and had no idea. At first he was like “nope, I don’t wanna do that.” Then the next day he hunted me down and asked to talk again because he had an idea. His idea is to create a blog around his path to becoming a writer. <br /><br />Now, let me just say right here and now that I opened my speech at this conference by telling authors to stop blogging about writing. Author after author creates blog after blog and 90% of the time, they are about the process of writing. Readers don’t care how much you slave over the words that entertain them, they just don’t. Once they love you a single blog post about your process may be novel but post after post, no way.<br /><br />Now, with that said there are sometimes exceptions or variations to the rule. This guy I believe is a rare exception but do let me explain. He is going to take what Susan Mary Malone has taught me, is a Hero’s journey. This guy has a goal and he has no clue how to achieve it or what the path is going to look like. He is going on a journey to chase a dream and he will have many adventures along the way, I just know it. While we already know that his quest is to be an author, you could insert anything in this path such as being a craftsman or building a flying model planes. <br /><br />See this concept is already not just about being a writer but rather shooting for a dream and the process of what that involves. He will deal with family issues, time issues, picking out tools, genre struggles and so much more than he can even imagine. If he does this well and sticks with his dream, people will care about him and really want to read his book. However, note that it could be that they want to buy that unusual bench that he made or that weird wooden speaker or whatever.<br /><br />With that said, he asked me what he should do next and below is what I said to him. <br /><br />Ok so here is what you wrote to me in your questionnaire:<br />I figure a couple hours of just blogging, but remember, the topic will be learning how to write.  I will spend much more time developing that skill which will provide fuel for the blogging.<br /><br />So you have a dual path and one means nothing without the other. We should call these Author Path and Blogger Path.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you do something towards Author Path right now, unless of course your wife wants you to unpack, the wife always comes first.<br /><br />Author Path<br /><br />Note: I am making these up and should just get your brain flowing but I would ask and answer a few questions:<br /><br />#1: What is the first step to becoming a writer?<br /><br />I just finished this book last night: <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1G9cpmN\" rel=\"noopener\">http://amzn.to/1G9cpmN</a> and you may want to read it. Do you have a Kindle?<br /><br />#2: What am I going to write about?<br /><br />Pick a first focus.<br /><br />#3 How much time am I going to dedicate and when?<br /><br />Make a commitment to yourself and then announce it to the world. Make sure that it fits with family time and is wife approved. It really helps to have your spouse on board, just listened to a podcast about this, which is why I bring it up.<br /><br />Blogger Path<br /><br />Write a blog post that is about those first 3 questions. Yes, you don't have a blog yet but do these things and then we will discuss that.<br /><br />Blog on,<br />-Renee'<br /><br />P.S. When are you going to do this?<br /><br />So what do you think folks?

            "description": "Do you know what your competitors are doing online?<br /><br />It is not that you want to become a spy but you do want to spend some time spying around. You need to know what your competitors are doing online. This will help you understand the scope of your blogging business, gain new ideas and make sure that you are actually competing. <br />As a blogger we are super focused on creating content or we should be. Sometimes we are just obsessing about it or is that just me? It is important to take a step back and see what others are doing, figure out what we could improve upon and make sure that we are in line and on track. <br />I did this recently and I realized that I am missing the boat a bit by not providing great downloads. I should be creating give-aways for the readers and creating check lists. Now, I am working on that and will be creating some to accompany my post popular posts. That was my big take away from this exercise, what will be yours?<br />You are going to want to set aside about two hours for this task but I do believe it will be well worth your time.<br />Here is a quick digital checklist for you:<br />. Make a list of 5 of your competitors<br />.Find each of their websites.<br />.Is their blog mobile responsive?<br />.Does their blog look current and attractive?<br />.How many post have they released?<br />.What is their frequency? (Look for a sitemap)<br />.When did the post their latest blog post?<br />.Do they have Social Media connected to their blog?<br />.Are they using Social Media?<br />Of course, you should do the same type of audit on your blog as well. It is important to take stock of where you are and where you should go with your digital marketing efforts.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

            "description": "I personally believe that the gap between and website is quickly fading but it sure isn’t completely gone. <br /><br />A blog shows a list of the latest post usually in chronological order. I say usually because if you are running a magazine style blog, the order may be shifted around based upon category.<br /><br />A blog usually has a feed associated to it so that readers can subscribe to it and get the latest post delivered in their email. <br /><br />A blog is focused on providing content over time vs a website that is often launched with pages and pages of content at once.<br /><br />About websites<br /><br />Websites are focused on static content. Static content is essentially content that stays in place. Imagine a website nav bar such as my friend’s site Aladdin Rentals and Events.com It has a home, event hall, linens, contact us etc. This site is focused on provided people with information about their services and their event hall. The primary purpose is for people see what they offer and then contact them. <br /><br />This is different than a blog when the primary purpose is keep them on the site, provide information and perhaps take then thru a sales funnel towards a product.<br /><br />Now, with all that said, let’s talk about a popular question that I get often: Can WordPress be for websites or is it just for blogs. The answer is YES. Every single website that I have ever built was built on WordPress. Heck, I just finished a website that is launching soon for a Bull Riders association. This is pure website and a massive one at that.<br /><br />WordPress is a content management system. While it was built as a blogging platform it doesn’t care what you put on the front page. You can quickly and easily set your front page to either be latest post or a specific page.<br /><br />The advantage to using WordPress as the bones of your website is all of the great plugins that you will have access to and the great themes that give you a jump start on style. <br /><br />So go ahead and build your website on WordPress and make your life easier.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

Without Google, Social Media or Paid Traffic. 15 Experts Show How <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1IhfXaA\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly/1IhfXaA</a><br /><br />Podcasting is by far my favorite medium for sharing all that I have learned and all that I know about blogging. However, when I launched my show I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. One Sunday afternoon I grabbed a laptop, opened up Garage Band and just started recording on a whim. I did not have a special microphone. I did not worry about background noises. I just started recording. If you are thinking about starting a podcast, here is a list of a few things that you should consider.<br /><br />1. Have a plan.<br /><br />The only difference between podcasting and blogging is the medium. In my blogging course, I always teach to have a set of categories and blog post titles before you launch. The same is true with podcasting. To be successful with podcasting you need to provide your audience with a steady stream of content on a reliable schedule and planning is the best way to do that.<br /><br />2. Sound quality matters.<br /><br />Put away the dogs, the kids and buy a decent mic. That first day when I recorded you could hear my dogs in the background and if you listened closely you could actually hear me. The internal mic provided on a laptop is not good enough, not even close. Now I use a Blue Yeti and I love it. Isolate yourself in a quiet room, sit close to your mic and speak up.<br /><br />3. Have a backlog.<br /><br />When I recorded that first episode, I released it out of excitement. Podcasting can quickly become a chore if you are not prepared. You should decide on a frequency in advance of launching your podcast and then I recommend that you have a backlog of 5 times that frequency before you launch. <br /><br /><br />4. Don’t hold back.<br /><br />Podcasting is an extremely intimate medium and that allows you the opportunity to truly connect with people in a way that words on a screen can never do. This is why you should allow your personality to shine thru and let people learn to know, like and trust you. If you spend all of your time behind the mic sounding stiff and buttoned up people will not relate to you and they will be less likely to share your podcast.<br /><br /><br />5. Make an offer.<br /><br />Make an offer in the podcast that you don’t make anywhere else. When I launched my podcast, I told people that if they emailed me their phone number, we could jump on the phone and talk about blogging. At that time, that offer was no where else. When you provide people with that kind of offer and then follow thru, they are far more likely to spread the word.<br /><br />6. Reach out.<br /><br />Don’t launch your podcast in a vacuum and hope that people will just find it. Tell the world about your podcast. Consider the following:<br /><br />A. Announce it to your mailing list.<br />B. Email your friends and family. Ask them to listen and to review.<br />C. Announce it on your blog.<br />D. Join Podcasting Groups.<br />E. Go to forums and connect with people.<br />F. Join a group in your Niche on Reddit.<br />G. Email other podcasters and introduce yourself.<br /><br />The best way to grow a podcast is to not stop podcasting. Just like growing any online presence, it takes time, dedication and a touch of luck.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

            "description": "A popular question that all of us bloggers tend to explore at some point is “How can I make money with this?” At a recent conference people were asking this question. The go to answer that I see a lot of people lean towards is making money with Google AdSense or something other ad service. There is nothing wrong with this answer. As a matter of fact, it is a perfectly fine answer. There are other options that may actually be a better answer for most bloggers. <br /><br />Now before I get into the other options, I want to share with you a formula. Just the other day, I released a tutorial how-to blog post about how to create a Google AdSense ad and how to place it in your WordPress sidebar. In that post, I also shared an article that someone wrote about how to make money with AdSense. <br /><br />The breakdown of the formula is this: You can theoretically make $380 bucks a day with AdSense but to do that you will need around 40,000 page views per day. <br /><br />If you are listening and are making that or more on just a few hundred a day, then please contact me and let me know how because that is awesome. <br /><br />The point of this formula is that you need a lot of visitors on your site to get enough folks clicking on those ads. It can take a long time and a great deal of effort to get that many readers and this is why I wanted to talk about another way.<br /><br />A while back, I read an article about how to make a living with a blog that has 100 readers a day. For the life of me, I can’t remember where I read that, so I can’t credit the author. I don’t recall all of the article but basically he said to consider other methods besides ads.<br /><br />So with that said, I thought that I would tell you a story. <br /><br />Story about Fred.<br /><br />Started DGC speaking<br />Stopped doing that and did other things.<br />Kept the blog going about custody though.<br />Now, he has a steady but low readership.<br />People reach out to him weekly, if not daily at times and ask him questions.<br />He can only help so many people one on one.<br />He realized, hey I know a lot about this topic.<br />Now he is making a course.<br /><br />So let’s go back to methods on making money with a blog:<br /><br />Coaching<br />Books<br />Courses<br />Teaching / Speaking<br />Other Products<br />Affiliates<br /><br />These are a few solid methods, so let me ask you. <br />What do you know? <br /><br />What do people constantly ask your advice on? <br /><br />What services can you offer that are related to your blog? <br /><br />Can you envision other methods of making money with your topic beyond ads?<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

            "description": "Hi guys, this is podcast #62 and I just wanted to talk about an experience that I just had with my blog. <br /><br />What is a content upgrade.<br /><br />What is the process:<br /><br /><br />What tools that I used:<br /><br />First you have to create a download. I looked at Google Analytics to see what some of my most popular blog posts were and then made a pdf based upon that topic. In my case, I took the highlights from two popular blog post: 5 SEO Tips and 7 Places to Submit your Blog for Organic Indexing.<br /><br />I ended up using a Power Point Template that I got from Hubspot. <a href=\"http://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates\" rel=\"noopener\">http://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates</a><br /><br />Note, that I did not write an ebook but rather created a simple 9 page document. It is not crammed with a ton of content but I did put 5 tips in there and the list of places to submit your blog for indexing.<br /><br />Also, I work on a mac and while I have Power Point on my machine, I found it easier to convert the document to Keynote and just use that. It made making links far easier.<br /><br />I also used Acrobat Pro to add some internal links to the document. Since I put an FAQ in there, I made the first reference to phrases such as meta title link to the appropriate spot on the document for a definition. This was actually one of the more challenging parts of this to figure out.<br /><br /><br />The next step was to set all of this up so that people could sign up for my newsletter and get the document. There were stages along the way on this that I really struggled with. I actually agonized over this stage far more than I should have and spent far more time on it than I thought that I would. <br /><br />My struggles:<br /><br />Grasping the process. Frankly, I was over thinking it instead of just doing it. It seemed to simple and I thought that I was surely missing it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here is how it works:<br /><br />Step 1: Someones find this page and signs up: <a href=\"http://iteachblogging.com/5-seo-tips-welcome-page/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://iteachblogging.com/5-seo-tips-welcome-page/</a> or they sign up from the pop-up<br /><br />Step 2: They are redirected to this page<br />Step 3: They receive their email and are redirected to this download page<br /><br /><br />#2 Second issue was a key part of the software that I was not finding clear direction on. Yes, of course, that is a blog post for me in the future, gotta love it. <br /><br />So the software that I am using is Thrive Leads: <a href=\"https://thrivethemes.com/leads/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://thrivethemes.com/leads/</a> and it is so wonderful. The issue that I had: Where to put the link for Step 2. I could not figure out how to do this and it took me far too long and watching far too many videos. This is not going to translate well on audio but when you are setting up your lead box, pop-up, whatever you call it, you will choose your mailing list that it goes to and then you can choose for them to be redirected to a page. Like I said, does not translate well and this is why I will be making a tutorial in the near future.<br /><br />#3 I struggled with copywriting. I did not expect this to be so challenging but it was difficult to choose a headline and teaser copy. You guys will have to let me know what you think and how I did.<br /><br />So this is a great tool and it was a blast creating the content upgrade, I hope that you all will sign up for it and let me know what you think.<br /><br />Blog on,<br />-Renee'<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

You know how it goes, you go shopping for a few new outfits, but you don’t clean out the old. I mean come on, we could possibly want to wear that some day... right?<br /><br />It is common to do the same thing with our WordPress sites. When we first start building our websites or blogs, we try on new themes. We may activate a theme, try it on for a while then decide that we don’t like it. Before long our WordPress blog has 4 or 5 themes just sitting around waiting to be hacked.<br /><br />Yeah, I said \"hacked\" because sadly that happens from time to time.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/iteachblogging</a>",

The Domain Name Service (DNS) can be thought of much like a directory or phone book. If you need to contact someone via telephone but only have his/her name, you can always check the phone book for their telephone number. The same applies when dealing with the Internet although this kind of \"lookup\" often happens in the background, unnoticed.<br /><br />Do you have FTP access?<br /><br />The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.whoishostingthis.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.whoishostingthis.com/</a> hosting<br /><a href=\"https://www.whois.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.whois.net/</a>  domain <br /><br />Whose name are all of the items in?

            "description": "I Digress a bit, so just humor me!<br /><br />My phone beeps and dings and vibrates right off of the table all day long. Each time that happens I assume something exciting has happened and I got a text from a friend or an important call. Instead it is just a Facebook comment to a comment that I made, that I should not have made in the first place. See, while I am well versed in Social Media for Business, I am not so well versed in Social Media for Personal.<br /><br />An example: The other day I saw a facebook update of someone who was selling a couch because they were getting a new one. I commented \"how exciting. I hope that you love your new couch.\" It turns out that it was a the HEB Buy Sale Trade page and it was just a stranger trying to sell a couch.<br /><br />## But Renee’ you teach Social Media<br />Yes, I do teach social media and I am really good at that. I understand how to use the tools and the platforms but I don’t teach social. There is a difference between understanding social media and understanding social. Don’t worry, I have friends and I spend time with them. However, I don’t interact with them well on social media. Actually, I don’t hardly interact on social media with my friends at all.<br /><br />I use social media as a tool. It is a method for me to gain information. I love following tech leaders and blogging leaders and WordPress know-it-alls. Social Media is a wonderful way to learn about new products. Social Media is a wonderful way to learn new tips and tricks. It is how I find all of the content that I read. <br /><br />It just so happens that in my case, I tend to filter out things such as a camel getting tickled and what my best friend had for dinner. I have much rather have dinner with my best friend and hear those stories than read about them on Facebook.

We analyze everything that we do and we tend to doubt ourselves often.
