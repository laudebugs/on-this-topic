Alan Dyer at Discovery.com says it's ''a lot of fun, and breaks the mold for NASA videos.'' Recently a top-10 finalist for ''Best Science/Technology Podcast'' at the 2008 Podcast Awards, IRrelevant Astronomy is packed with CG animation and snarky humor, all wrapped around the latest astronomy news and science from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. It's infrared-relevant! Also available in HD.",
