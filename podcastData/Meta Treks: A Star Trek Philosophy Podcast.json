            "description": "<p>Gnosticism, Esotericism, and Secrecy in Star Trek.<br />  <br /> We often take for granted that philosophers and Starfleet officers mean what they say. But there is a rich history of esoteric writing in the history of philosophy, whether for pedagogical, protective, or political purposes. The same is often true within the Star Trek universe itself. All of Star Trek can interpreted as a form of esoteric expression on the part of its creator Gene Roddenberry as a way of expressing his own social and political messages while evading television censors of the late 1960s. And within the Star Trek universe, from starship captains and Federation diplomats to the esoteric practices of and ceremonies of various alien races and religions, certain practices, beliefs, and various forms of dangerous knowledge are kept secret from the average Federation citizen and Starfleet officer. In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling lift the veil of secrecy to explore and reveal the many forms of gnosticism, esotericism, and secrecy in the Star Trek universe.</p> <p>Chapters<br /> Intro (00:01:19) <br /> Initial Thoughts (00:02:59) <br /> The Naivety of Enterprise and Knowledge in the Interstellar Community  (00:10:31) <br /> Neoplatonist Gnostic Societies (00:14:10) <br /> Janeway and the Omega Directive (00:18:02)<br /> Different Types of Esotericism (00:20:16)<br /> Simon Tarses, Julian Bashir and Defensive Esotericism (00:26:23)<br /> Challenging the Notion of the Star Trek Universe as a Utopian Ideal (0030:56)<br /> Captain Archer and Political Esotericism in A Night in Sickbay (00:37:44)<br /> Deep Space Nine and the Federation Agenda (00:44:08)<br /> Pedagogical Knowledge and The Traveler from TNG (00:48:31)<br /> Parables, The Gospels, and Theological Esoteric Knowledge (00:53:24)<br /> Geordi's Powerpoints and Pedagogical Clarity (00:58:36)<br /> Klingon Tea Ceremonies and Performative Expressions of Knowledge (01:04:04)<br /> Secret Societies and Secret Knowledge in the Star Trek Universe (01:05:47)<br /> Young Tuvok and Pedagogical Esotericism (01:12:29)<br /> Is the Q Continuum Q-soteric?

And while Season 1 of Enterprise had important overarching themes, such as human technological progress, showing the Star Trek universe to be a possible future for us in the emerging 21st century, getting back to Star Trek's roots as a \"wagon train to the stars,\" and building unity through diversity, Season 1 of Enterprise had several philosophically important episodes as well.

            "description": "<p>Death Wish.</p> <p>Nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche held that Western philosophers from Socrates onward have had a gigantic death wish in the form of philosophical escapism and denial of our nature as finite, embodied beings with our own uniquely individual perspectives, drives, and desires. Philosophers in the Q Continuum likewise seem to have a death wish, especially Quinn, the Q Continuum's greatest philosopher.</p> <p>In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison discuss the philosophical and existential themes in the second-season Voyager episode \"Death Wish.\" Although \"Death Wish\" is usually interpreted as a moral dilemma about assisted suicide—itself a hot moral topic since the 1990s—Zachary and Mike argue instead that \"Death Wish\" is a subtler but highly-developed example of Nietzschean philosophy of embodiment, perspectivism, and metaphorical self-expression. </p> <p>Zachary and Mike also discuss the question of meaning as it relates to death, the finitude of human life, and the possibility of immortality—in the Q Continuum or in any form of the afterlife.</p> <p>Chapters<br /> Intro (00:01:19)<br /> Initial Thoughts on Voyager: \"Death Wish\" (00:03:32)<br /> Philosophical Overview and Examples of Nietzschean Philosophy (00:06:43)<br /> Quinn: Genius or Madman?

            "description": "<p>Utopianism in Star Trek.  </p> <p>The Star Trek universe is sometimes claimed to be a utopia. From technological progress to an enlightened view of human nature and equal opportunity, the vision of the future depicted in Star Trek is often touted by fans as the best possible future for humankind. An often-overlooked aspect of utopianism, however, is that \"utopia\" literally means \"no place,\" calling into question the plausibility of such an optimistic future. </p> <p>From intragalactic wars to power-hungry admirals to secret government organizations, the struggles of the 23rd and 24th centuries are all very familiar to us here in the 21st century, potentially undermining the very notion of human progress for which Star Trek is so famous. With the overall darker tone of Star Trek: Discovery and, to a lesser extent, Star Trek: Enterprise before that, it is reasonable to ask whether fans themselves, when pressed, really do still believe in the Star Trek vision of the future. </p> <p>In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling discuss utopianism in the Star Trek universe, whether Star Trek should really be considered a utopia after all, the dark sides of \"perfect\" societies, and the importance of having an idealistic vision of future human society—a modern-day take on a futuristic Plato's Republic—whether or not that ideal future is possible to achieve.  </p> <p><br /> Chapters<br /> Intro (00:01:19)<br /> Initial Thoughts on Utopianism in the Star Trek Universe (00:01:55)<br /> DS9 and Criticisms of Federation Utopia (00:06:33)<br /> What Ways is the Society of the 24th Century Utopian?

In Star Trek, these alternate universes are just as real as the actual universe, a philosophical position known as \"modal realism.\" In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison debate modal realism, the reality of alternate universes, through the lens of the Star Trek universe and whether we should consider alternate realities or \"possible worlds\" to be as metaphysically real as our own actual universe.  </p> <p><br /> Chapters<br /> Intro (00:01:19)<br /> Initial Thought on Modal Realism (00:04:04)<br /> What Difference Does It Make?

Yet we hunger and thirst for meaning, as humans have done since the dawn of human history and consciousness. To its fans, Star Trek has become a form of modern mythology, with its own ethos, purposefulness, and meaningfulness, and with its own epic heroes—whether Captain Kirk in the Original Series or Michael Burnham in Star Trek: Discovery—whose journeys, struggles, and overcoming of obstacles are reminiscent of the existential journeys of classical epic heroes, from Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey to Dante Alighieri in the Divine Comedy.  </p> <p>In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling discuss the philosophical themes in season one of Star Trek: Discovery, from speculative and theoretical issues in contemporary physics and biology—emergence, panspermia, and panpsychism—to existential questions of self-identity and self-definition—including the rise, fall, and redemption of Michael Burnham, the Federation's struggle to maintain its ideals during wartime and in the face of imminent threats to its very existence, and the emerging unification and national identity of the Klingon Empire.  </p> <p>Chapters <br /> Intro (00:01:19) <br /> Initial Thoughts About Star Trek: Discovery - Season One (00:2:31) <br /> Essential Trek Philosophy Essentials (00:17:19) <br /> Context is for Kings (00:19:06) <br /> The Vulcan Hello / Battle at the Binary Stars (00:27:07) <br /> The Butcher's Knife Cares Not for the Lamb's Cry / Choose Your Pain (00:37:50) <br /> Lethe (00:42:43) <br /> Will You Take My Hand?

And does the property of \"redness\" exist as an abstract entity (similar to numbers or other abstract objects), or does color exist only in particular form within individual colorful objects like individual red uniforms?  </p> <p>In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison discuss the philosophy of color in the Star Trek universe. From the physics of light to the physiology of color perception, and from concrete examples to the ontology of abstract entities, Zachary and Mike examine why physics and physiology struggle to give a fully adequate account of the existence and nature of color.</p> <p>Chapters <br /> Intro (0001:20) <br /> Is There a Philosophical Problem?

These metanarratives have included things like the <em>Enlightenment</em>, the <em>Scientific Revolution</em>, <em>Democracy</em>, <em>Marxism</em>, <em>Emancipation</em>, and many other competing metanarratives that have made up the tapestry of Western civilization.  <br /> <br /> <em>Star Trek</em>, likewise, has its grand metanarratives, which tie together individual stories and narratives into a unified message about the future potential of humankind. These <em>Star Trek</em> metanarratives include things like <em>technological progress</em>, <em>political unification</em>, <em>eliminating economic scarcity</em>, and so on. But having seen the collapse of many of these grand narratives of Western civilization, or at least their dark underbellies, many people in today's postmodern times now take a skeptical view, or even a cynical one, about the plausibility of these idealistic grand metanarratives.  <br /> <br /> In this episode of <em>Meta Treks</em>, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling, discuss the use of narratives and metanarratives in <em>Star Trek</em>, addressing the fundamental question of whether <em>Star Trek</em>'s grand narratives will end up on the same ash heap of history as other discarded metanarratives of Western civilization, or whether the grand narratives of the <em>Star Trek</em> worldview have the staying power to persist into the 24th century and beyond.  </div> <div><br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Intro (00:01:20) <br /> Distinguishing Between \"Narratives\" and \"Metanarratives\" in <em>Star Trek</em> (00:05:08) <br /> Collapse of the Grand Narratives of the Western World (00:12:08) <br /> <em>Star Trek</em> Snake Oil (00:14:57) <br /> The Power of Oratory - Motivating Change with Metanarratives (00:24:47) <br /> TNG \"The Neutral Zone\" - Timeless Ideals vs. Contemporary Metanarratives (00:32:08) <br /> The Importance of Critical Skepticism (00:45:23) <br /> DS9 \"The Storyteller\" - Telling a Great Story (00:50:58) <br /> TNG \"The Inner Light\" - Appeals to the Heart (00:57:28) <br /> Cultural Apathy - Working for the Weekend vs. Working for the Future (01:03:15) <br /> Non-Reductive Perspectivism - Embracing Grand Narratives (01:08:25) <br /> Hero of Your Own Story - The Center Seat vs. Scrubbing Plasma Conduits (01:13:24) <br /> Final Thoughts (01:20:12) <br /> Closing (01:29:53)  <br /> <br /> <strong>Hosts</strong> <br /> Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling  <br /> <br /> <strong>Production </strong><br /> Mike Morrison (Editor) Zachary Fruhling (Producer) C Bryan Jones (Executive Producer) Matthew Rushing (Executive Producer) Ken Tripp (Executive Producer) Patrick Devlin (Associate Producer) Kay Shaw (Associate Producer) Richard Marquez (Production Manager) Brandon-Shea Mutala (Patreon Manager)  </div>",

How should Starfleet officers weigh the high-stakes, life-or-death consequences for an entire civilization against their responsibility and oath to uphold the Prime Directive?

What ethical and practical constraints should be placed on the pursuit of knowledge?

Both Worf and Socrates were accused of corrupting the minds of the youth, both were protesting the perceived injustices and irrationality of the established state, and both were sentenced to death by execution (a fate escaped by Worf more successfully than by Socrates!). <br /> <br /> In this episode of <em>Meta Treks</em>, hosts Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison discuss the similarities and dissimilarities of Worf and Socrates. Had Worf been successfully executed, would Worf have been remembered in future Klingon history as a martyr and as the founder of a new Klingon philosophical movement, Worfism (and eventually neo-Worfism), emphasizing the ideal form of the Klingon Empire? <br /> <br /> In addition, Zachary and Mike discuss ancestral and cultural identity, both in the galactic melting pot of the <em>Star Trek</em> universe and in our globalized society here in the real world. Finally, not forgetting the subplot of the emergence of Lt. Commander Data's newfound ability to dream, Zachary and Mike discuss the role and significance of dreams and mythology in a modern, progressive, scientific, and rationalistic society.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 65 (00:01:06) <br /> Worf and Socrates (00:03:08) <br /> Worf the Martyr and Neo-Worfism (00:10:56) <br /> Slavery, Melting Pots, and Cultural Identity (00:28:13) <br /> Fatherless Data and Worf - Identity and Meaning (00:37:10) <br /> Klingon Beatnik - \"Hey, Mr. Bat'leth Man, Slay a Targ for Me\" (00:48:48) <br /> Modernity, Dreams, and Mythology (00:56:11) <br /> Cosplay and Choosing Your Own Identity (01:07:44) <br /> Final Thoughts (01:11:10)  <br /> <br /> <strong>Hosts <br /></strong>Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison  <br /> <br /> <strong>Production <br /></strong>Mike Morrison (Editor) Zachary Fruhling (Producer) Matthew Rushing (Executive Producer) Ken Tripp (Executive Producer) C Bryan Jones (Executive Producer) Patrick Devlin (Associate Producer) Kay Shaw (Associate Producer) Kit Loffstadt (Associate Producer) Richard Marquez (Production Manager) Brandon-Shea Mutala (Patreon Manager)  <br /> <br /> <strong>Send us your feedback! <br /></strong>Twitter: @trekfm <br /> Facebook: <a href=\"http://facebook.com/trekfm%C2%A0\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer\">http://facebook.com/trekfm</a> <br /> Voicemail: <a href=\"http://www.speakpipe.com/trekfm%C2%A0\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer\">http://www.speakpipe.com/trekfm</a> <br /> Contact Form: <a href=\"http://www.trek.fm/contact%C2%A0\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer\">http://www.trek.fm/contact</a> <br /> Visit the Trek.fm website at <a href=\"http://www.trek.fm/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.trek.fm/</a> <br /> Subscribe in iTunes: <a href=\"http://itunes.com/trekfm\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer\">http://itunes.com/trekfm</a>  <br /> <br /> <strong>Support the Network! <br /></strong>Become a Trek.fm Patron on Patreon and help us keep Star Trek talk coming every week.

In this episode of <em>Meta Treks</em> hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling discuss the ethics of invisibility. Do these fictional invisibility devices reveal the true darkness of our inner nature, or is the power of invisibility a seductive and corrupting force that leads to a spiral of moral decay? Is it possible, through the cultivation of moral virtues, habits, and training, to shield oneself against the influence of the temptations of anonymity?

In this episode of <em>Meta Treks</em>, hosts Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison discuss Ferengi virtue ethics, or which character traits uniquely define the Ferengi. But is this drive for profit an essential biological or psychological Ferengi instinct, or is the drive for profit a culturally reinforced learned behavior? Join Zachary and Mike as they discuss the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition and the need for a kinder, gentler Ferenginar. <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters</strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 55 (00:01:43)<br /> Initial Thoughts on the Ferengi (00:02:52)<br /> Rules of Acquisition: Rule-Based Ethics or Virtue Ethics?

In the early 20th century, a philosophical movement known as \"logical positivism\" attempted to specify criteria that could be used to demarcate meaningful language from non-meaningful language. These logical positivists, such as Rudolf Carnap and A.J. Ayer, claimed that only empirically verifiable statements are meaningful, and that any language not empirically verifiable is literally meaningless.  <br /> <br /> In this 50th episode of <em>Meta Treks</em>, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling examine the claims of logical positivism through the lens of <em>Star Trek</em>. From the story-based use of language in the TNG episode \"Darmok\" to the many possible uses of the word \"dilithium,\" Mike and Zachary offer a <em>Star Trek</em> based critique of logical positivism inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein's account of the meaningfulness of language as its use in various context-dependent \"language games.\"  <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 50 (00:01:07) <br /> Separating Science from Pseudoscience - Only Empirically Verifiable Statements are Meaningful (00:03:29) <br /> \"Turkey Hot\" - Replicators and Reference (00:07:46) <br /> \"Dilithium!\" - Wittgenstein and Meaning-as-Use (00:10:23) <br /> Empiricism - Do We Have Direct Sensory Access to the External World?

Mike, Zachary, and Duncan consider various forms of exceptionalism, both here in the real world and in the <em>Star Trek</em> universe. Are humans exceptional lifeforms with unique properties and abilities compared to other life forms here on Earth? In the <em>Star Trek</em> universe, do humans have unique or exceptional abilities compared to members of various alien species? Is the Federation an exceptional political entity compared with neighboring political organizations such as the Romulan Empire or the Ferengi Alliance? How does Federation Exceptionalism compare and contrast with so-called American Exceptionalism?

Neece and</strong> <strong><em>The Gospel According to Star Trek.  </em></strong><br /> <br /> In this episode of <em>Meta Treks</em>, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling are joined by author and speaker Kevin C. Neece to discuss his new book, <em>The Gospel According to Star Trek: The Original Crew</em>. This first book in the <em>Gospel According to Star Trek </em>series explores the constructive connections between Star Trek and Christian theology. Kevin C. Neece argues that the humanism expressed in <em>Star Trek</em> is compatible with a rich tradition of Christian humanism, and that <em>Star Trek</em>'s relationship with religion is more complex and nuanced than the typical atheistic interpretation recognizes. From Spock as a Christ metaphor in <em>Star Trek II</em>, <em>III</em>, and <em>IV,</em> to false Gods in The Original Series, Kevin C. Neece, Mike Morrison, and Zachary Fruhling explore the many-layered connections between the adventures of the original crew of the <em>U.S.S.

Dante's semi-autobiographical, mythical tale of a redemptive and self-reflective journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, led by the poet Virgil (Dante's symbol of human reason) and the lady Beatrice (Dante's symbol of divine love), has become an archetypal metaphor for going astray and being led back to one's true path.  <br /> <br /> Many characters in the <em>Star Trek</em> universe have gone astray, whether literally as in the case of the <em>Voyager</em> crew lost in the Delta Quadrant, or metaphorically as in the case of characters with deep personal struggles, such as Wesley Crusher, Worf, and Benjamin Sisko. These and other <em>Star Trek</em> characters who have gone astray are frequently visited by quasi-mystical messengers, analogous to Virgil and Beatrice in <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, who lead them on a journey and back to their own true and unique paths.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 35 (00:01:06) <br /> Initial Thoughts on <em>The Divine Comedy</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> (00:01:45) <br /> The Doctor's <em>Inferno</em> (00:04:55) <br /> \"Shattered\" and Other Dante References in <em>Star Trek</em> (00:09:31) <br /> Virgil [Human Reason] and Beatrice [Divine Love] (00:17:16) <br /> Wesley's <em>Inferno</em> (00:21:47) <br /> Comparing Kirk/Spock/McCoy with Dante/Virgil/Beatrice (00:27:09) <br /> Virgil and Beatrice [Picard and Troi] on the Enterprise-D (00:33:52) <br /> \"Midway Through Life's Journey\" (00:50:31) <br /> <em>Voyager</em> - Tom Paris, Captain Janeway, and Harry Kim (00:57:11) <br /> Worf's <em>Inferno</em> (01:05:51) <br /> Benjamin's <em>Inferno</em> (01:15:38) <br /> Other Examples and Final Thoughts (01:26:43)  <br /> <br /> <strong>Hosts <br /></strong>Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison  <br /> <br /> <strong>Production <br /></strong>Mike Morrison (Editor and Producer) Norman C.

Zachary and Mike consider the core philosophical questions about the nature of time, such as ontology (whether the past and the future really exist), duration (why time moves at the rate it does), movement (whether there is a flow of time or whether events are fixed in time), linear time versus branching time, subjective time versus objective time, reconciling relativistic physics of time with quantum physics of time, and whether time is \"out there\" or imposed on reality by the mind.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 33 (00:01:20) <br /> Initial Thoughts on \"Cause and Effect\" (00:04:39) <br /> Spacetime - Time is Malleable (00:14:32) <br /> The Physics of Time and the Metaphysics of Time (00:16:06) <br /> Four Dimensionalism - Do the Present and Future Exist?

Many different kinds of speech acts can be found inside <em>Star Trek</em>, including taking oaths and granting promotions, saying wedding vows and pronouncing marriages, naming androids and christening starships, auto-destruct commands, replicator orders, and transfers of command, to name a few. Zachary and Mike discuss different examples of performative utterances in <em>Star Trek</em> and the role they play in a free society.  In addition, Zachary and Mike consider objections to the concepts of speech acts and performative utterances from the philosophical standpoints of relativism and reductionism. <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters</strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 31 (00:01:23)<br /> What are Speech Acts and Performative Utterances?

Although <em>Insurrection</em> is not usually cited as a fan-favorite among TNG-era <em>Star Trek </em>films, <em>Insurrection</em> is a classic <em>Star Trek</em> morality play containing an impressive number of philosophical layers, given its otherwise lighthearted tone.  <br /> <br /> In this episode of <em>Meta Treks: A Star Trek Philosophy Podcast</em>, hosts Mike Morrison and Zachary Fruhling explain their fondness for S<em>tar Trek: Insurrection</em> and discuss its interwoven philosophical themes, such as the ethics of forced relocation and eminent domain, balancing the needs of the many with the rights of the few, civil disobedience and the responsibility to act on moral conviction, anti-technological social commentary, the themes of family and reconciliation, the Ba'ku Fountain of Youth and the meaning of life in the 24th Century, and the importance of finding joy in small moments, even in the face of great trials.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 30 (00:01:32) <br /> Memories of <em>Star Trek: Insurrection</em> (00:03:36) <br /> Initial Thoughts (00:06:27) <br /> Relocating the Ba'ku - The Needs of the Many vs. the Rights of the Few (00:16:14) <br /> Comparing Insurrection and TNG \"Journey's End\" (00:26:04) <br /> Moral Conviction and Civil Disobedience - The Responsibility to Act (00:29:14) <br /> The Ba'ku and Anti-Technological Social Commentary (00:34:57) <br /> Reconciliation Theme (00:39:40) <br /> The Fountain of Youth and the Meaning of Life (00:43:07) <br /> The Human Condition - Finding Joy in Small Moments (00:51:31) <br /> Son'a as Prodigal Children (00:55:14) <br /> Are the Son'a in Thomas Hobbes's State of Nature?

From the Risa-like Federation penal colony in New Zealand to engramatic purges and twenty-year virtual prison sentences, <em>Meta Treks</em> hosts Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison discuss the ethics of the various forms of punishment seen in the <em>Star Trek</em> universe. Zachary and Mike debate the different possible justifications of punishment in general, such as punishment as a deterrent, punishment as getting what you deserve, punishment as maximizing social utility, punishment as repaying a debt to society, punishment as redemption, and punishment as education. Given the real-world issues of increasing prison populations and the culture of criminalization, <em>Star Trek</em> provides a model of the best (and sometimes the worst) of human nature and of our ideals about how to handle the ever-present problems of crime and punishment in society.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Chapters </strong><br /> Welcome to Episode 29 (00:01:06)<br /> New iTunes Review (00:02:45)<br /> <em>The Ready Room</em> - 200th Episode (00:06:35)<br /> Initial Thoughts on Punishment in <em>Star Trek</em> (00:10:15)<br /> Luxurious Federation Penal Colonies (00:12:19)<br /> Federation vs. Non-Federation Punishment (00:13:30)<br /> Possible Justifications for Punishment (00:15:21)<br /> Intentionality and Gradations of Punishment (00:19:06)<br /> The Death Penalty in TOS \"The Menagerie\" (00:21:02)<br /> The Variety of Punishments in <em>Star Trek</em> (00:26:49)<br /> Virtual Punishment - Chief O'Brien in DS9 \"Hard Time\" (00:29:49)<br /> Engramatic Purge - B'Elanna Torres in VOY \"Random Thoughts\" (00:35:59)<br /> Paying Debt to Society (00:41:00)<br /> The Evolution and Future of the Prison - Michael Foucault (00:44:09)<br /> The Bell Riots and the Culture of Criminalization (00:48:14)<br /> The Punishment Box in DS9 \"Paradise\" (00:55:23)<br /> Klingons - The Presumption of Guilt and Hereditary Punishment (00:58:12)<br /> Compassion and Punishment - Cue the Picard Speech (01:06:05)<br /> The Role of Anger and Disgust - Vulcan Logic or Human Emotion?

One of the most important issues in the\nworld today is how far a society should go to protect itself. What\nfreedoms should we be willing to give up for sake of safety and\nsecurity? Should a government be allowed to spy on its own\ncitizens? And is it morally and ethically permissible to start a\npreemptive war with a real or perceived enemy? <em>Star Trek Into\nDarkness</em> tackles this last question head-on through Admiral\nMarcus's attempt to start a preemptive war against the Klingons.

            "description": "<p><strong>Klingon Virtue Ethics. </strong><br />\n<br />\nFor Klingons, the key ethical question is whether one's heart is\ntruly Klingon. In this episode of Meta Treks, hosts Zachary\nFruhling and Mike Morrison examine \"Klingon Virtue Ethics,\" with\nvirtue ethics being a distinctive form of ethical theory\nemphasizing desirable character traits over individual actions.\nZachary and Mike debate the nature of essential Klingon character\ntraits such as loyalty, duty, and honor. But unlike humans, who\ntend to remain in the middle-ground on many aspects of human\nnature, Klingons take their essential virtues and character traits\nto extreme levels (not to mention those terrible Klingon table\nmanners and an endless but life-affirming thirst for blood\nwine). <br />\n<br />\nIn their discussion, Zachary and Mike cover the Aristotelian notion\nof eudaimonia (\"happiness,\" or \"living well\") and consider what\nliving well, or rather dying well, means for Klingons. In addition,\nZachary and Mike apply the virtue-theory notion of an \"ideal\nindividual\" to the Klingon messianic figure Kahless, the individual\nviewed by most Klingons as the ideal Klingon to be emulated and\nrevered. Finally, Zachary and Mike contrast the highly idealized\n(and sometime naive) sense of Klingon virtues embraced by the\ncharacter of Worf with the more realistic character traits of other\nless-honorable Klingons. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>Chapters</strong><br />\nWelcome To Episode 7 (00:01:25)<br />\nDiscussing SacTrek  (00:02:48)<br />\nOverview of Virtue Ethics (00:11:26)<br />\nTraditional Virtue Ethics Theories (00:14:48)<br />\nVirtue Ethics In Star Trek (00:16:52)<br />\nDiscussion of Eudaimonia (00:24:39)<br />\nFinal Thoughts (01:07:29)<br />\nZach's Recommended Klingon Episodes (01:10:53)<br />\nMike's Recommended Klingon Episodes (01:11:26)<br />\n<br /></p>\n<div><strong>Hosts</strong></div>\n<div>Zachary Fruhling and Mike Morrison</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Production</strong></div>\n<div>Dennis Castello (Editor and Producer) Norman C.\nLao (Executive Producer) C Bryan Jones (Executive\nProducer) Matthew Rushing (Executive\nProducer) Charlynn Schmiedt (Executive Producer) Will\nNguyen (Content Manager) Richard Marquez (Production Manager)<br />\n<br />\n<div><strong>Send us your feedback!</strong></div>\n<div>Twitter: @trekfm </div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\n\"http://facebook.com/trekfm%C2%A0\">http://facebook.com/trekfm </a></div>\n<div>Voicemail: <a href=\n\"http://www.speakpipe.com/trekfm%C2%A0\">http://www.speakpipe.com/trekfm </a></div>\n<div>Contact Form: <a href=\n\"http://www.trek.fm/contact%C2%A0\">http://www.trek.fm/contact </a><br />\n\nVisit the Trek.fm website at <a href=\"http://www.trek.fm/\" target=\n\"_blank\" data-behavior=\"truncate\">http://www.trek.fm/</a></div>\n<div>Subscribe in iTunes: <a href=\n\"http://itunes.com/trekfm\">http://itunes.com/trekfm</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Support the Network!</strong></div>\n<div>Become a Trek.fm Patron on Patreon and help us keep Star Trek\ntalk coming every week.

Is free will an indispensable concept as\npragmatism holds? As Captain Kirk, Captain Sisko, and Captain\nJaneway learn to embrace their own unique destinies, do they become\ngenuine examples of the compatibility of free will and determinism\nin Star Trek?
