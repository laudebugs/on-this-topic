Through meeting the founders of Spindrift, Bruce and John Klingbeil, Bill began to grasp new ways of applying consciousness research to religion and science. He was president of Spindrift for four years. He graduated from New Trier High School, which was the top public high school in the country at the time and attended Illinois State University where he received a communications degree.\r\n",

He has been tearing the music world asunder for almost three decades and has a life that he has lived to the fullest. Fowley’s life story is chronicled in Stay Ugly: The Life and Near Deaths of King Fowley, chronicling Fowley’s early days, how DECEASED formed, the D.C.- area metal scene of the mid-’80s, and how King escaped death multiple times. King nearly died from a horrendous blood clot, survived a stroke and kicked drugs and alcohol, two addictions that had a complete stranglehold on him.\r\n",

Cremo, also known by his devotional name Drutakarma dasa, is an American freelance researcher who identifies himself as a Vedic creationist and an “alternative archeologist” and argues that humans have lived on Earth for millions of years.  In his book, Forbidden Archeology, Cremo argues for the existence of modern man on Earth as long as 30 to 40 million years ago! We talked with Michael about his research into “forbidden archeology” and dove deep into some consciousness talk, spiritualtiy + science and much more. Michael has made appearances on top talk shows such as Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and the popular History Channel show, Ancient Aliens. \r\n\r\nMichael is also offering listeners of Ghostly Talk a FREE copy of the Bhagavad Gita, the book that motivated Michael to take the path he’s on, when you order his newest book, My Science, My Religion: Academic Papers (1994-2009). Just mention you heard the offer on the show when you order. \r\n",

            "description": "Author of The Holly Water Incident William Dorian joins us to preview his new book. \r\n\r\nWilliam was first introduced to the paranormal world when he became friends with Eileen Curren Murphy, the daughter of Pearl Curren, the internationally famous channel for the Patience Worth spirit who wrote best selling and critically acclaimed novels, poetry and short stories via the Ouija board and automatic writing during the first three decades of the 20th century. Dorian and Eileen also contacted Patience during their brief friendship in 1974-75 in New Orleans, Louisiana, through the Ouija board and later Eileen’s automatic writing. \r\n\r\n     Even after he no longer lived near Eileen, Dorian found he could still communicate with Patience via the Ouija board and continued to do so for 20 years, primarily as something of a parlor trick/party game. Never seeing anything evil or harmful in the practice, he frequently played ‘ouija’ with his daughter, Brittany, after she got to be a teenager. \r\n\r\n     That, of course, is when ‘all hell broke lose’ and Brittany started contacting negative entities on the Ouija board without her father being present. This eventually led to her possession by demonic entities when she was 15 and several exorcisms and a haunting of their home for 17 years. The haunting finally ended when Renee’ Anderson and her paranormal team ousted the offending spirits in 2017.\r\n",

We speak with Faith at 10pE; at 9pE, Clarissa, leads us through the bran new year’s weirdest True Crime headlines.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn Thursday, January 4 at 9 PM ET/PT, Discovery will head to Isle of Wight County, Virginia to investigate a brutal cold case in the third season of the network’s hit true-crime series KILLING FIELDS, this time subtitled “Murder Isle.”\r\n\r\nIsle of Wight is an isolated Virginia farmland community near the Chesapeake Bay, but the quiet community was marked by a gruesome homicide its residents cannot forget. In the summer of 2004, 28-year-old Carrie Singer was found beaten to death and half naked in a field. But who would have wanted her dead? And why could they never connect any DNA with the actual crime?\r\n",

About John: A minister is a member of the clergy who attends to the emotional, mental, and spiritual needs of a person. Metaphysics means beyond the physical world and is used as a catch-all phrase to describe any or all of the following subjects: ESP, Dreams, Mysticism, World Religions, Astrology, Tarot, Numerology, Positive Thinking, Reincarnation, Meditation, Transpersonal Psychology, Parapsychology, the Paranormal, New Thought, New Age, Self-Help, Mind/Body/Soul  Connection, and Enlightenment Studies. In other words, a metaphysical minister is someone that attends to the emotional, mental, and spiritual needs of other people through the knowledge and use of these subjects and skills. While everyone is on their own spiritual path – some people need and want a guide to help them discover or better understand their path and life. Rev. John Culbertson has been proudly and professionally helping people apply spiritual principles and techniques to improve their lives since 1998. When you call Rev. John Culbertson you are calling someone who has spent his entire life, since he was a child, studying and applying spiritual principles. He has helped people throughout the world and chances are he’ll help you too.\r\n",

            "description": "It’s one man’s word against another’s in the highest stakes game of all: execution for murder. In a compelling and wrenching episode of After Hours AM/The Criminal Code — with hosts Joel Sturgis, Eric Olsen, and secret weapon, forensic psychologist Dr. Clarissa Cole — we discuss the new Investigaton Discovery docu-series KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP with producer Kevin Huffman. We speak with Kevin in hour 2; at hour 1, Clarissa leads us through the week’s strangest True Crime news. Barry Van Treese, owner of the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City, was found beaten to death in a room at the inn on January 7, 1997. A man with no prior felony convictions, Richard Glossip, steadfastly maintains his innocence, insisting that he had no knowledge that anyone planned to kill Van Treese. Justin Sneed, who admitted to killing the victim with a baseball bat and whose fingerprints were found in the room, cut a deal for a life sentence instead of risking the death penalty by claiming that Glossip hired him to do it. With acclaimed filmmaker Joe Berlinger’s cameras following in real time in what could be the final days of his life, KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP tells the story of a former motel manager sentenced to die for orchestrating a murder he swears he had nothing to do with. KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP premieres in an exclusive two-night event Monday, April 17th and Tuesday, April 18th at 9/8c on Investigation Discovery. Richard Glossip’s death sentence is based primarily on the testimony of Justin Sneed, the motel maintenance man who was convicted of Van Treese’s murder and sentenced to life without parole\r\n",
