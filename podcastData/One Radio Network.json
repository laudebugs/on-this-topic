            "description": "Dr. Andrew Kaufman\nCOVID Truths, COVID Lies\nDr. Andrew Kaufman is an American natural healing consultant, inventor, expert witness and forensic psychiatrist who has been powerfully outspoken throughout the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking counter to the mainstream media, Dr. Kaufman has stated that a virus is not causing a new disease, there is no evidence of increased mortality and modern medicine is the leading cause of death.\n\nHaving studied at MIT, Duke and the Medical University of South Carolina, he has published original research and lectured, supervised, and mentored medical students in all psychiatric specialties. His knowledge and experience has qualified you as an expert witness in local, state, and federal courts.\n\nShow highlights:\n\nThe particles coming off dying cells are said to be viruses, but what about exosomes? What are they and how they fit into the pandemic picture; the science is actually clear, just suppressed\n\nWhat creates exosomes? What is their purpose?\n\nCan we share exosomes with others through coughing, sneezing, etc\n\nThe problem with testing for COVID\n\nDr. Kaufman has been one of our favorite docs to follow since the pandemic hit; he makes so much sense\n\nPatrick asks Dr. Kaufman about ‘germ theory’\n\nNow is the time to start looking outside the allopathic model\n\nConcerning viruses, what’s happening in a laboratory doesn’t necessarily correlate to what’s happening in a person\n\nHow big pharma hijacked healthcare; creating new vaccines by creating new viruses\n\nSo is there evidence of a new disease? Have there been a rise in mortality worldwide this year? The answer is ‘no’. Dr. Kaufman elaborates on the numbers\n\nPeople have been killed for no reason through poor protocols",

            "description": "Dr. Mark Sircus\nHigh Performance Health\nDr. Mark Sircus, Ac., OMD, DM (P) (acupuncturist, doctor of oriental and pastoral medicine) is a prolific writer and author of some astounding medical and health-related books. Dr. Sircus’s methods are based on medical science and long years of clinical experience, not only his own but experiences of doctors from around the world who have been practicing brilliant medicine.\n\nHis books are heavily referenced, but the layperson finds little difficulty in understanding his presentation of medical topics. For many years Dr. Sircus has been researching into the human condition and into the causes of disease; he has distilled many of the divergent medical systems into a new form of medicine that he has coined Natural Allopathic Medicine.\n\nNatural Allopathic Medicine represents a new therapeutic principle that revolutionizes both allopathic and naturopathic medicine offering a radical shift in medical thought and practice. Dr. Sircus’s protocol addresses foundational physiology. It focuses on pH management, cell voltage, magnesium and iodine medicine, cannabinoid medicine, carbon dioxide medicine, re-mineralization of the body, increasing oxygen transport and oxygenation of the tissues, opening up of blood vessels, saturation and healing of cells with concentrated nutrition via superfoods, breathing retraining, emotional transformation processing, detoxification and removal of heavy metals and radioactive particles.\n\nThe exciting part of Dr. Sircus’s protocol is that it is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. Secondly, with a recent medical breakthrough—a legalized form of medical marijuana now available throughout the world—Dr. Sircus’s protocol is entirely legal.\n\nWith the publication of Dr. Sircus’s Treatment Essentials book, which actually teaches people to put into practice this medical approach, anyone will now have access to the information that will enable them to take charge of their own health.\n\nDr. Sircus’s approach is humanitarian because it pays attention to the majority who cannot afford expensive medical treatments or pharmaceutical drugs. With the Natural Allopathic Medicine protocol, people with limited funds can make use of the top three medicinals mentioned above—magnesium chloride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and iodine—to inexpensively treat most health problems. Add breathing retraining, CBD, superfoods, vitamin C, plenty of water good enough to be called a medicine, enough sun, daily magnesium massages and one will improve or cure almost any ailment.\n\nVisit Website\nShow highlights:\n\nDr. Sircus had quite a morning which is why we got on the air later than usual. He had a hypertension health scare in which his blood pressure was 180/116. Luckily, for him, hi wife and maid, who is also a nurse, were able to lend support with massage, tea, hydrogen inhalation, etc to bring his blood pressure down\n\nWhy is he experiencing this crisis? He’s worried about the election and the state of the world and the control being imposed on the world’s population\n\nThe news media seems to have decided upon a president, but it’s not true at this point\n\nThe whole left agenda is very, very dangerous and it doesn’t seem to be stopping. The elites continue to push and push\n\nHow does one not allow oneself to get upset about what’s going on?\n\nIs there still a chance for a reversal of the election through recounts? Patrick thinks so and tells us why\n\nDr. Sircus talks about climate change\n\nWas 9/11 an inside job? Dr. Sircus has no doubt that it was\n\nMark saw all this control coming down the pike 20-30 years ago\n\nAre calcium supplements necessary\n\nWe had to cut our interview a bit short due to a bad connection but Patrick soldiered on and shared a damning video of Dr. Anthony Fauci",

I’ve listened to at least a half a dozen interviews of Morley from various internet radio programs over the last few years and this one of yours (Aug 11, 2020) is THE BEST! – thanks and I’m looking forward to your follow up interview with him. – John\n\nMorley Robbins is the creator of The Root Cause Protocol.\n\nMorley (aka. “Magnesium Man”) is one of the foremost experts on Magnesium’s role in the body, and the delicate dance Magnesium plays with Iron, Copper, and Calcium.\n\nIn 2012, Morley founded the Magnesium Advocacy Group (GotMag.org).\n\nAnd he remains the de facto leader of the Magnesium Advocacy Group on Facebook, with over 175,000+ members (and growing daily).\n\nAs a certified health coach with an expertise in Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA), Morley has performed over 4,500 one-on-one consultations with clients from around the world.\n\nShow highlights:\n\nOxidation IS the cause of disease\n\nIs it better to give blood and then have blood work done or to have blood work done and then give blood?\n\nQuestion from a listener: I just had blood work done and see that Ferritin is  246 on a scale of (8-180 from UCLA labs). My T3 total is 79 on a scale of (85-185 mg/dl from UCLA labs)  should I be concerned?\n\nWhy is Molybdenum so bad?\n\nQuestion from a listener: I understand how important copper is and how difficult it is to achieve sufficient copper for metabolic health – but for those of us who can’t afford testing, etc.,  would you please make clear how we can most simply and inexpensively make bioavailable copper more available to us so that our body can absorb it if it needs it (aside from avoiding Vitamin D supplements and any other things we should avoid that interfere with copper)?\n\n Is there an alternative supplement for retinol? \n\nIf the RBC magnesium test comes back in the optimal range, how should the RCP be modified (should the amount of magnesium taken be reduced)?\n\nIf the cerrulloplasm test is already in the optimal range, does this mean bioavailable copper is already optimal?  In this case is it not necessary to follow the RCP? \n\nIs there a place in the protocol for Sulphur?\n\nHow often should I repeat a Full Monty blood panel? \n\nQuestion from a listener: If a person had the genetics for hemochromatosis, would you recommend your standard Root Cause Protocol?  That same person has Factor V Leiden, a genetic disorder that predisposes them to clotting, and takes daily heparin injections for it.  Any special considerations for either the hemochromatosis or the Factor V Leiden?",

Not through a requirement for devotion or ritual, or with structures of belief – but rather by stepping beyond the scaffolding that has maintained your sense of reality.\n\nNot an inert volume of knowledge, but a living, vibrating entity that continues to reveal itself with every engagement, The Agreement is both a principle and a living essence. \n\nDiscover the power of Agreement within the five pillars of your human experience, and ignite your inherent capacity to create a new reality. Agreement is the key to unlocking your limitation for experience. \n\nAgreement is the key to your freedom.\n\nVisit Website\n\nShow highlights:\n\nWe are shifting out of a cyclical based mechanical based reality\n\nThe agreement is learning how the mechanics of reality of the 5D works\n\nThe agreement is about less energy required and all about resonance; we’re experiencing a system upgrade\n\nReturning to sovereignty through our collective consciousness; we’re learning how to not rely on external forces\n\nRebecca understood reincarnation and energy fields even as a young child\n\nHumanity has known about the shift into 5D for a very long time and it’s ready for it\n\nThe shift is almost like a physical death; it’s leaving people unsettled and unsatisfied with their lives\n\nRebecca tells us why there has been a huge increase in disease recently\n\nRebecca gives her opinion of 5G; choosing which technology we wish to engage inIt is",

Whitehead\nThe Election Has Already Been Hijacked and the Winner Decided: ‘We the People’ Lose\nRepublicans and Democrats alike fear that the other party will attempt to hijack this election.\n\nPresident Trump is convinced that mail-in ballots are a scam except in Florida, where it’s safe to vote by mail because of its “great Republican governor.”\n\nThe FBI is worried about foreign hackers continuing to target and exploit vulnerabilities in the nation’s electoral system, sowing distrust about the parties, the process and the outcome.\n\nI, on the other hand, am not overly worried: after all, the voting booths have already been hijacked by a political elite comprised of Republicans and Democrats who are determined to retain power at all costs.\n\nThe outcome is a foregone conclusion: the Deep State will win and “we the people” will lose.\n\nThe damage has already been done.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which has been tasked with helping to “secure” the elections and protect the nation against cyberattacks, is not exactly an agency known for its adherence to freedom principles. (continue reading)\n\nJohn Whitehead is an attorney and author who has written, debated and practiced widely in the area of constitutional law, human rights and popular culture.\n\nWidely recognized as one of the nation’s most vocal and involved civil liberties attorneys, Whitehead’s approach to civil liberties issues has earned him numerous accolades and accomplishments, including the Hungarian Medal of Freedom and the Milner S. Ball Lifetime Achievement Award for “[his] decades of difficult and important work, as well as [his] impeccable integrity in defending civil liberties for all.” As nationally syndicated columnist Nat Hentoff observed about Whitehead: “John Whitehead is not only one of the nation’s most consistent and persistent civil libertarians. He is also a remarkably perceptive illustrator of our popular culture, its insights and dangers. I often believe that John Whitehead is channeling the principles of James Madison, who would be very proud of him.”\n\nShow highlights:\n\nNo one is the savior of our liberties, not even Donald Trump\n\nThe Deep State and the corruption in Washington, DC; we live in a money elite, they are running the show; the money always wins; since Covid-19 hit, the 12 richest people in the world have won big\n\nWe ought to distrust all those who are in power\n\nHow far back does this corruption go in the US\n\nProject Paper Clip\n\nThe rampant censorship in America\n\nThe power of your local government and the importance of getting involved\n\nWho pulled off the COVID-19 Scamdemic?\n\nand more!\n\nVisit website",

It’s why he became a psychotherapist in addition to being a cardiologist near the end of the Vietnam War to help his patients with the constant cloud of looming stress that he says we are now living in again during the COVID era. Dr. Sinatra says social distancing creates another emotional twist that we have never experienced: lack of human connection, which he says is vital to stress reduction for heart health. Dr. Sinatra will be here to talk to us about ways to compensate for the lack of physical and emotional support in order to maintain healthy blood pressure, cognitive function and emotional well-being and how to manage the aftermath of COVID-19 infection and what specific heart health questions you should be asking your doctor.\n\nDr. Stephen Sinatra is one of the most highly respected and sought-after cardiologists whose integrative approach to treating cardiovascular disease has revitalized patients with even the most advanced forms of illness. Previous to working with Healthy Directions, he has more than 40 years of clinical practice, research, and study by starting his career as an attending physician at Manchester Memorial Hospital in Connecticut where he then went on to serve as chief of cardiology, director of medical education, director of echocardiography, director of cardiac rehabilitation and director of the weight reducing program. Sinatra is also founder of the New England Heart Center, where he became known as one of America’s top integrative cardiologists by combining conventional medical treatments for heart disease with complementary nutritional, anti-aging and psychological therapies. \n\nShow highlights:\n\nDr. Sinatra tells us about when he learned how emotional stress and crisis can cause heart attacks\n\nThe Covid lockdown has caused loneliness and despair\n\nDr. Sinatra gives us his take on COVID-19\n\nDr. Sinatra’s biggest A-ha moments regarding the heart; CoQ 10 and grounding/earthing were gamechangers\n\nWhat walking barefoot does for the body and why walking on concrete and asphalt is ineffective\n\nCholesterol only becomes a problem when it oxidizes; we need cholesterol\n\nCoQ 10 is the magical source to protect the body; everyone should take it\n\nA word about statins; is there an upside to statins?\n\nThe major killer in heart disease\n\nChildren with the highest cholesterol, when afflicted with MRSA do fine and MRSA is a deadly staph infection which proves that cholesterol can be very protective\n\nWhy post menopausal smoking women are at greater risk for heart disease\n\nThe best and worst foods for the heart\n\nThe magic of green apples, onions, and black tea\n\nWhy olive oil is connected to longevity\n\nThe best exercise for healthy heart maintenance\n\nVisit website",

If not, Trump’s term officially ends on January 20th and congress can put in whoever they want.\n\nRichard Proctor is a retired professional who has been a member of the Constitution Party for over 10 years, and previous candidate for the State of Utah Auditor in 2008 & 2012.\n\nThe goal of the party in Utah is to spread the message of “Honoring God, Defending the Family, and Restoring the Republic to the principles given us by the Founding Fathers”.  This is the same message fostered by the Founding Fathers.  They understood that to remain a free and prosperous nation their message needed to be embedded in the hearts and minds of each succeeding generation of Americans.  The two major parties have failed miserably in that responsibility. The Constitution Party leadership is finding that this message resonates well with Utahans as it should.  This is especially true of those conservatives who are moving to Utah.  All of the state officers and nearly 70% of the county leadership are filled by transplants to this state. Our challenge is simply to get that message out to the public. Regardless of how difficult this task is, the party is intent on achieving it.  As in other states, those coming into the party in Utah are not only disenfranchised republicans, but many democrats and independents as well.  They are fully aware that the message of our Founding Fathers is a timeless one and one that is fitting to every generation of Americans.\n\nThe stage is possibly set for a deadlocked election, where some states will not certify the electoral votes, and on January 20th. if that is the case,\n\nDonald Trump is no longer President, and according to the 20th. Amendment, Congress can put in who ever they want.\n\nRichard Proctor explains how the 16th. Amendment, for direct taxes, was initiated before the Federal Reserve Act, as they are connected.  Our taxes, back the dollars the FED Bank creates.\n\nHe says the 16th. Amendment is abhorrent to the Constitution and thus, not true law.\n\nHe says the Supreme Court has been a political court rather than Constitutional Court since John Jay.\n\nThe way Representatives are distributed in the House is unconstitutional\n\nMost of what The U.S. Government does is with a wink and a nod, and unlawful.\n\nNo person in government can take away your God given rights regardless of how many “emergencies” they claim are present.\n\nVisit website",

            "description": "Tom Cowan, MD\nThe Contagion Myth : Why Viruses(including Coronavirus) are Not the Cause of Disease\nFor readers of Plague of Corruption, Thomas S. Cowan, MD, and Sally Fallon Morell ask the question: are there really such things as “viruses”? Or are electro smog, toxic living conditions, and 5G actually to blame for COVID-19?\n\nThe official explanation for today’s COVID-19 pandemic is a “dangerous, infectious virus.” This is the rationale for isolating a large portion of the world’s population in their homes so as to curb its spread.  From face masks to social distancing, from antivirals to vaccines, these measures are predicated on the assumption that tiny viruses can cause serious illness and that such illness is transmissible person-to-person.\n\nIt was Louis Pasteur who convinced a skeptical medical community that contagious germs cause disease; his “germ theory” now serves as the official explanation for most illness. However, in his private diaries he states unequivocally that in his entire career he was not once able to transfer disease with a pure culture of bacteria (he obviously wasn’t able to purify viruses at that time). He admitted that the whole effort to prove contagion was a failure, leading to his famous death bed confession that “the germ is nothing, the terrain is everything.” \n\nWhile the incidence and death statistics for COVID-19 may not be reliable, there is no question that many people have taken sick with a strange new disease—with odd symptoms like gasping for air and “fizzing” feelings—and hundreds of thousands have died. Many suspect that the cause is not viral but a kind of pollution unique to the modern age—electromagnetic pollution. Today we are surrounded by a jangle of overlapping and jarring frequencies—from power lines to the fridge to the cell phone. It started with the telegraph and progressed to worldwide electricity, then radar, then satellites that disrupt the ionosphere, then ubiquitous Wi-Fi. The most recent addition to this disturbing racket is fifth generation wireless—5G. In The Contagion Myth: Why Viruses (including Coronavirus) are Not the Cause of Disease, bestselling authors Thomas S. Cowan, MD, and Sally Fallon Morell tackle the true causes of COVID-19.\n\nOn September 26, 2019, 5G wireless was turned on in Wuhan, China (and officially launched November 1) with a grid of about ten thousand antennas—more antennas than exist in the whole United States, all concentrated in one city. A spike in cases occurred on February 13, the same week that Wuhan turned on its 5G network for monitoring traffic. Illness has subsequently followed 5G installation in all the major cities in America.\n\nSince the dawn of the human race, medicine men and physicians have wondered about the cause of disease, especially what we call “contagions,” numerous people ill with similar symptoms, all at the same time. Does humankind suffer these outbreaks at the hands of an angry god or evil spirit? A disturbance in the atmosphere, a miasma? Do we catch the illness from others or from some outside influence?\nAs the restriction of our freedoms continues, more and more people are wondering whether this is true. Could a packet of RNA fragments, which cannot even be defined as a living organism, cause such havoc? Perhaps something else is involved—something that has upset the balance of nature and made us more susceptible to disease? Perhaps there is no “coronavirus” at all; perhaps, as Pasteur said, “the germ is nothing, the terrain is everything.” \n\nBuy the book\n\nIt was banned on Amazon so it must be GREAT!!",

            "description": "Richard Maybury\nFounder of The Early Warning Report\nCensorship & Propaganda Is In Overdrive in America\n\nRichard Maybury is widely regarded as one of the top free-market writers in America. His articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and other major publications.\n\nRichard Maybury publishes one of the most well respected newsletters on investing in the World: Early Warning Report. He’s asked us to give you a link, as his gift to the April-May 2020 newsletter. Enjoy\n\nPresident of Henry Madison Research, Inc., Mr. Maybury is a world-renowned author, lecturer and analyst who consults with business firms and individuals in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMr. Maybury is often compared to General Billy Mitchell. You may remember that Mitchell foretold the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; he was one of those rare individuals with the amazing knack for seeing through the “conventional wisdom” and political smoke screens, to spot crucial new trends – the kind that catch most other experts by surprise.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Mr. Maybury warned about a coming world war between Washington and Muslims, but few listened, just as few listened to Mitchell.\n\nEver since 9-11, thousands have been hanging on Mr. Maybury’s every word. Subscribers who have been taking his advice — to invest in things that do well in wartime — have been reaping astounding profits.\n\nMr. Maybury calls his viewpoint “Juris Naturalism,” which means the belief in a natural law that is higher than any government’s law. This, incidentally, was also the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and the other American founders.\n\n“Let me be very clear about this,” Mr. Maybury states. “I’m proud of my viewpoint and do not try to hide it behind a smokescreen of phony objectivity. I believe political power is the most evil thing humans ever discovered. It corrupts the morals and the judgment.”\n\nMr. Maybury has written 22 books and monographs, including his Uncle Eric series of books, which focus on economics, law and history. He has been interviewed on more than 250 radio and TV shows across America, on topics ranging from monetary policy, investments and business cycles to the geopolitics of the Mideast oil region and former Soviet Union, as well as U.S. foreign policy.\n\nDo not be left in the dark about changing world events and their impact on you, your money, and your family. Know what others don’t, and subscribe to U.S. & World Early Warning Report today.\n\nVisit Website\n\nShow highlights:\n\nWe share with Mr. Maybury, according to one of our guests from this week, that 99.9% of the people under 70 years old will not die of COVID-19; COVID-19 is a statistical lie. Mr. Maybury explains his findings and it looks like it comes down to money paid to lie\n\nWe’re taught that “we” are the government be we are not; if that were the case, things would most definitely not be this screwed up\n\nRegarding the public school system, all the textbooks have been censored and are full of propaganda. Mr Maybury knows as he and his wife were teachers\n\nMr. Maybury has written excellent books for home schoolers; we’ve read many of them and they are great\n\nFacts about WW2 we’re sure you’ve never heard before; how the war was sold to the American people\n\nMr. Maybury shares his theory about how most politicians were probably bullied in their youth\n\nThe definition of “government”\n\nPatrick asks Mr. Maybury about the solar industry, which he says is very political\n\nThe political side of the CA fires\n\nThe worst thing you could do for a person is give them money. He explains\n\nThe young people today are being taught that they are fragile and worthless; they can’t cope at all with the real world",

There’s been a global deluge of contradictory opinions, fake news, and politically controlled information.

Meaning, it’s pretty benign\n\nThe deadliness is very different among viruses. For example, rabies is very deadly but the common cold is not\n\nHow deadly is this coronavirus? Maximally, it’s like a bad flu\n\n99.9% of individuals did not die from this virus below 70 years of age\n\nThis virus has mutated many times over; it’s a very different virus that came out of Wuhan\n\nCoronaviruses, flu and cold viruses circulate peacefully among populations and have since the beginning of time. So why do people get sick? Dr. Bhakdi explains\n\nViruses train your immune system; they actually strengthen the body in the long run\n\nSheltering yourself from microbes and germs, particularly children is a bad idea.\n\nWhat’s the difference between coronaviruses and the common cold virus\n\nThe regular flu virus that comes around every year kills more people without pre-existing illnesses than COVID-19\n\nDr. Bhakdi breaks down all the numbers.

Dr.Daniels is widely considered one of the foremost Alternative Healing Physicians alive today. She graduated from Harvard University with Honors receiving a BA degree. Her education continued at the University of Pennsylvania where she received her Medical Degree (MD) and also attended Wharton where she received her MBA in Health Care Administration. She practiced medicine for 10 years as a Board Certified Family Practice Physician where she saw first hand the power of Natural Methods.\nShe has been coaching clients to successfully heal naturally since 1985. She is the author of the award winning book, Do You Have the Guts to Be Beautiful?\n\nHealers Home Study Course\n\nhttp://vitalitycapsules.com/health_accelerator_sale1\n\nConsultation with Dr. Daniels\n\nhttp://drjenniferdaniels.com/\n\nCandida Cleaner Report:vitalitycapsules.com\n\nYou can get Dr. Daniel’s free report on using turpentine safely and effectively.  Get the\n“Candida Cleaner” here.\nShow highlights:\n\nIf you believe there is a virus you are right. If you believe there is no virus, you are right.\nDr Daniels shares how she came to this conclusion and why it is good news for you.  No microscope needed. \n\nQuestions from our listeners that Dr. Daniels addressed:\n\nWhat are some herbs and supplements that can properly repair an intense case of gastritis? Changing the diet from High-Carb to Moderate-Carb to Low-Carb didn’t make any difference, and neither has altering the intake of proteins and fats or trying different probiotic supplements. Most herbs and spices seem to irritate the issue even further, and no dairy has been consumed for years.\n\nDoes Dr. Daniels know of some home remedies that can successfully reverse a receding hairline, especially to regrow the hair over the temples?\n\nI have a bladder infection that seems to be hanging on for weeks off and on. Drinking lots of water and cranberry and d mannose supplements. Would turpentine help?\n\nHow would Dr. Daniels suggest to deal with E. Coli in the bladder once you have them in there. She mentioned to keep the environment acidic to avoid them. But how do you get properly rid of them without antibiotics?\n\nAnd: is taking bi-carbonate as suggested by Dr. Sircus making it easier for the E. Coli to survive?\n\nMale in his late 50’s experiencing tooth loss, chipping etc. Also, I grinds teeth while sleeping. Any thoughts or recommendations?\n\nWhat can a woman do about crepe skin?   It is a horror!   Will MSM get rid of it, eat it, spray it on?   Will anything at all make it go away?\n\nWhat is your opinion about plastic surgery?\n\nWhat causes a touch to the rear of the scalp to  cause a sensation of pins and needles, and what may be done about restless leg syndrome?  \n\nI have heard the turpentine can dissolve cataract\nHow do I apply it?\nI have had one eye done four years ago and will need my other eye operated on in the near future as I am down to 80% vision. \nAlso I have some very rough skin on my nose. (I think it is from sun damage)/I have tried using castor oil for the last few months but no improvement yet. Anything else I can try to get smooth skin again?\n\nWhen I fall to sleep and subsequently wake up in 15 minutes or several hours later in the middle of the night all of the joints in both hands are incredibly painful. Once I start to move them the pain starts to subside and is gone in about 2-3 minutes time? Any idea what could be the root cause of this. I was diagnosed with Cancer 6 years ago and have been treating it by my self with nutrition, specific supplements and clean water. I do not think it is related to the affliction however I could be wrong",

This danger was enunciated by State Senator Richard Black (a former Colonel and intelligence officer) during a September 5 conference.\n\nIn his powerful speech which won the ire of top Pentagon brass, Trump called for finally bringing America’s troops home, and ending the “endless wars” saying:\n\n“I’m not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren’t, because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs, and make the planes, and make everything else, stay happy. But we’re getting out of the endless wars…. Let’s bring our soldiers back home.”\n\nFor those devout Trump haters who are unwilling to accept the possibility that there has been an active coup run against the President for the past 3.5 years, or that the oncoming economic meltdown (unleashed under the cover of COVID-19) and general civil war danger within the USA might usher in a coup d’etat… think again.\n\nThe fact is that America has come closer than many think to total military dictatorship under Wall Street/London controls on more than one occasion, and unless the lessons of history are quickly internalized, then not only will this happen again, but it will accompany a new world war from which very few lives rich or poor would be spared.

He invents world changing technology but does not patent it. Instead he sells the information and devices goes directly to the public and teaches as many people as he can how to duplicate his innovations. Yes, several people have used his technologies to make millions and not paid Mr. Wiseman a dime. But that is OK by Mr. Wiseman, because he is trying to get his innovations actually USED by the public. He thinks of himself as an alternative energy researcher and started his business, Eagle-Research, in 1984; at first selling fuel saving information and technology. He was able to revolutionize that genre, not only inventing several practical fuel savers, but also the technology that allowed fuel savers to interface with modern fuel systems. He then became an expert in Browns’ Gas, also known as HHO or HydrOxy, and has focused on that for the last 20 years. Fuel Savings was just one of the more than 30 useful applications for HydrOxy. Another Mr. Wiseman optimized was using HydrOxy to replace torch fuels like acetylene.\nThe application he is currently focused on is HydrOxy for health.  Hydrogen for health is fast becoming one of the most important innovations of all time and Mr. Wiseman is guiding the technology into using practical and SAFE technologies to apply it.\n\nCheck out the AquaCure\nuse promo code oneradio for 10% discount",

            "description": "Ben Swann\nTruth in Media\n\nBen Swann has spent 20 years working as a journalist in broadcast news, behind and in front of the camera. Swann began his journalism career in El Paso, Texas as a news photographer, quickly working his way up to prime time anchor.  Along the way, Swann’s investigative reporting transformed the laws in New Mexico regarding child abuse resulting in death, leading Governor Bill Richardson to recognize him for his tireless work on behalf of children. Swann also became a two-time Emmy Award winner and two-time recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award. It was while covering Mexico’s drug war, Ben Swann discovered the national media was not reporting the truth of what was actually happening in Mexico’s drug war or the problems associated with the failed “War on Drugs” in the United States.  \n\nIn 2010, Ben moved north to Cincinnati, Ohio, taking the prime time anchor seat at FOX 19 and soon became the producer/anchor of a viral segment titled “Reality Check.”  Covering the 2012 Republican Presidential primary, Swann confronted problems in the American electoral process, the stranglehold of America’s two party system and the suppression of voters’ choices by mainstream media. During this time, Swann became the first journalist in the nation to interview and confront President Barack Obama face to face regarding the Constitutionality of his “kill list” and is the only journalist to confront Mitt Romney about the railroading of duly elected delegates during the 2012 Republican National Convention.  Swann’s groundbreaking Reality Check was praised by journalism professors and publications such as The Atlantic as being “more than just a fact check.”\n\nSwann’s bold approach created an internet firestorm strong enough for Swann to venture from his position as anchor at FOX 19 in Cincinnati, launching his own independent platform. Upon establishing the Truth In Media Project at BenSwann.com in June of 2013, Swann’s brand met immediate success.\n\nSwann launched the Truth in Media project through crowdfunding and has created two seasons of “Truth in Media” videos that examined subjects such as the truth behind cannabis and CBD oil, the origin of ISIS, the roots of police militarization and more. These videos have millions of combined views online.\n\nBen Swann is now the industry leader for independent journalists, shattering the “Left vs. Right” paradigm, with a sharp focus on restoring Truth In Media. With over 750,000 combined social media followers, 120,000 YouTube subscribers, and monthly pageviews surpassing 2 million per month, Swann’s impact and influence is undeniable.\n\nIn May of 2015, Benswann.com expanded its role as a disruptive force in American media and made the transition to TruthinMedia.com, partnering with even more voices across the political spectrum. Also in 2015 Swann became the prime-time anchor for CBS46 in Atlanta.  Swann brought his Reality Check series to Atlanta and saw unprecedented success.  His Reality Check segments saw over 110 Million video views on social media, with engagement and viewership higher than CNN, Fox News and Vice News on Facebook.\n\nIn 2018, following a hiatus from Truth In Media and Reality Check, Swann revived both with thanks to an exclusive sponsorship from the network of Dash, a digital currency system. Swann became the first independent journalist to fund a news program exclusively with cryptocurrency.  Dash’s revolutionary, decentralized network harmonizes with Swann’s longstanding commitment to objective and independent reporting. With this historic partnership, Swann, Truth In Media and Reality Check are continuing to speak truth to power.  Today, Ben is a contributor on news and cryptocurrency issues for RT America as he works to build a free speech platform for news and entertainment sources.\n\nhttps://ise.media/",

I am thrilled waiting for the next one. I have known his work for quite some time, but it is so refreshing to listen to your shows. I hope you will carry on with cooperation. Dr Peat has endless knowledge to share and each time I listen to him I find something new and eye-opening. His knowledge and perspective are absolutely unique. In the world of keto, low carb nonsense, sugar hate and corrupted science, he is the last voice of honesty and sanity.” Best regards Ania from Poland\n\nRay Peat acquired his PhD from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He started his work on hormones in 1968 and wrote his dissertation in 1972 in which he outlined his ideas on progesterone and the hormones closely related to it. His main thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.\nPlease consider signing up to Dr. Peat’s terrific newsletter.  Comes out every other month at an incredibly low cost..email Dr. Peat here\nDr. Ray Peat is on One Radio Network the third Monday of every month.\nHe’s been wearing an N95 mask due to all the smoke in Oregon, where he’s currently living.\n\nSmoke particles are even smaller than the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Peat discusses the relationship between viruses and pollution. The highest “virus” mortality is concentrated in the highest pollution areas,” says Dr. Peat, for example, Wuhan, Italy, and New York City.\n“It’s the soil that the virus or pollution falls on,” according to him.\nDr. Peat talks about inflammasomes, cytokines, and the “so-called” ACE2 receptor.\nThe ACE2 protein knocks out inflammation. The virus itself is not the problem. It’s the inflammatory process.\n\nPumping oxygen into people is killing patients by increasing inflammasomes.\nCreating antibodies to coronavirus means you’re resistant to the virus, not sick with it. “If you change the language you can appear to make anything happen,” according to Dr. Peat.\nThe coronavirus “plan” was already worked out in detail in 2001 — to shift wealth to Google and the members of the World Economic Forum. Some billionaires have already doubled their net worth.\n\nDr. Peat discusses pulse and temperature in relation to the thyroid.\nHe refers to two books written by Dr. Broda Barnes.\nDr. Peat replies to a listener about inflammation.\nHe replies to another listener about eating liver.\nDr. Peat regards tryptophan and cysteine as “dangerous,” and connected to the inflammatory process.\nHe replies to more e-mails from listeners about fructose, orange juice, lecithin, histamine intolerance, etc.\nMushrooms have natural anti-inflammatory properties. They should be boiled for at least an hour to break down the carcinogenic substances.\nDr. Peat advises about doses of aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs.\nHe discusses how moving to a warmer, tropical climate (say Florida) can disguise what’s going on with the thyroid. At least the internal temperature will be favorably increased.\nDr. Peat advises a “good laxative” or antibiotics several days before surgery. Grated carrots is another option (using a little olive oil, vinegar, and salt).\nMany people have bacteria all the way up to their stomach. Most of the small intestine should be sterile.\n\nMen with high testosterone and low estrogen have less prostate cancer.\nSunlight is the best way to get vitamin D, plus keeping your calcium high compared to phosphate.\nSapotes and cherimoyas are good fruits to be eaten during autumn.\n\nDr. Peat listed various benefits of a progesterone supplement called Progest-E, including some dramatic cases of external application.\n\nEstrogen degrades tissue in various ways.\nHyperventilation means carbon dioxide is not being retained. That results in stress hormones.\n\nDr. Peat discusses “natural” desiccated thyroid supplements.\nA listener asks Dr. Peat about what happens after death. Also, will he ever play his cello on a show?",

He is an MD practicing Wholistic and Natural Medicine\ndocmassey@gmail.com\nGive Dr. Massey a call for a phone consultation\n830-992-1143\nDr. Richard Massey talks about addiction and habitual patterns.\n\n“I just hate real estate,” complained one of Dr. Massey’s clients. Dr. Massey asked her, “What is our first home? The womb.” He explains how real estate and the womb tie together, using Recall Healing.\n\n“What happened at your birth?” is an important question to ask.\n\n“My burden in life gets lighter.” Saying it can make diseases go away.\n\n“Almost always there’s a family story,” regarding all diseases, including thyroid diseases.\n\n“Biology is like the accountant. It keeps track of everything,” says Dr. Massey.\n\nPatrick asks for more information about the thyroid and it’s relationship to time. Dr. Massey replies in detail.\n\nPatrick’s question leads to a discussion about synchronicity and the nature of “time.”\n\nDr. Massey’s grandparents barely survived the “Great Miami hurricane” in 1926. His father became a weatherman.\n\nDiseases have two main causes — birth or family constellations.\n\nThis coronavirus is not the problem. “Each person will find their part in it,” Dr. Massey explains.\n\n“My cells are actually ejaculating exosomes. Somehow the word ‘virus’ got put on these little particles of connection.”\n\nVirus has meant “poison” for 500 years, “Exosome” is a much better word.\n\nDr. Massey didn’t wear a mask in the operating/recovery rooms, and he never caught anything.\n\n“When a doctor says, ‘Oh, my, there’s two small spots on the lung,’ we forget the several trillion that are functioning perfectly well.”\n\nPatrick discusses his sleeplessness. He speculates it’s about his compassion for what other people are experiencing (losing their businesses, etc.)\n\n“If I had any symptoms, I’d be staying home,” Dr. Massey says about the coronavirus, comparing his chances of survival at home versus a hospital, but it’s everyone’s choice, not personal advice.\n\nA listener asks Dr. Massey about testosterone. Dr. Massey personally takes a bio-identical version along with a little DHA and sometimes pregnenolone.\n\nA listener asks about rheumatoid arthritis. Dr. Massey talks about “telling the story so there are no victims or perpetrators,” then gives additional details about remedies that can make a difference.\n\nPatrick and Dr. Massey discuss pasteurization and “solution-mongers.”\n\nA listener has a “fluttering left ear.” Dr. Massey gives some practical advice.",

            "description": "Thomas Renz\nAttorney for Ohio Stands Up!\nCOVID: Major case filed against Ohio governor and the state of Ohio for restricting freedom without legitimate justification\n(READ FULL ARTICLE BY JON RAPPOPORT)\n\nAs the state of Ohio continues to discriminate against the elderly and promote fear amongst the population, Ohio Stands Up! is making progress in shining the light of justice on the issue. Recent days have seen some of the most incredible steps yet taken in Ohio’s response to a disease that is only slightly more dangerous to most people than a seasonal influenza. Pursuant to D.O.-Non-Congregate-Shelter-Second-Amended-08.31.20 the state is creating FEMA “prison camps” to place people that are “unable to self-isolate” and showing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nOhio Stands Up! attorney, Thomas Renz, said, “In working with our doctors and other experts we have become particularly troubled by this order. The symptoms of COVID-19 are the same or similar to a common cold, allergies, influenza, and even the side effects of some common medications. Since the test is inaccurate, even when used on the governor, how will we know who to imprison, and how will this imprisonment impact these people?”\n\nAttorney Robert Gargasz asked, “Isn’t this similar to what Governor Cuomo did in nursing homes in New York, putting potentially sick and healthy people together in the same settings? Are we poisoning the healthy?” He goes on to ask, “With new reports that deaths are now below pre-pandemic levels, how can these actions be justified?”\n\nGovernor DeWine noted recently that the state would be eligible for additional funds for undertaking this project. This seems to indicate that the State makes money for imprisoning people without trial.\n\nOhio Stands Up! is happy, however, to announce that it appears we will be able to enter into the discovery stage of the trial soon. Attorney Renz stated, “Discovery is a critical part of this trial. The State has consistently told us that there is a public health crisis but refused to share their basis for this assertion. As we proceed through discovery the State will no longer be able to hide their data and models. We will finally be able to see the truth and determine just how dangerous this ‘crisis’ really is. We look forward to deposing the relevant state and federal officials and seeing what they have to say under oath.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.ohiostandsup.org\n\nShow highlights:\n\nMr. Renz chooses his cases based on ethics\n\nHe started looking at the reaction over COVID-19 back in January; the reaction was totally bizarre compared to earlier illnesses\n\nIf this is about protecting life, then why did a woman with Stage 4 cancer who needed to have an operation, need to engage a lawyer to get an exemption to be able to get a life saving operation\n\nWhy is Mr. Renz suing the State of Ohio? He gives us the details\n\nLockdown vs house arrest; they have become indistinguishable\n\nWhat might justify serious actions imposed upon the public by the government?\n\nWhat will Mr. Renz need to show a jury during this trial?\n\nReviewing the REAL numbers\n\nNot a single scientist has been able to provide documentation that masks prevent viral spread\n\nMr. Renz believes in the court system and believes that if he can get a fair trial, he and his team will win\n\nWhen will this case go to court?\n\nEven the inventor of the PCR test said it’s not good for diagnosis\n\nWe either have a Constitution or we don’t\n\nFreedom is the one thing we all need to come together on; this is NOT a left vs right issue",

            "description": "Dr. Mark Sircus\nHigh Performance Health \nDr. Mark Sircus, Ac., OMD, DM (P) (acupuncturist, doctor of oriental and pastoral medicine) is a prolific writer and author of some astounding medical and health-related books. Dr. Sircus’s methods are based on medical science and long years of clinical experience, not only his own but experiences of doctors from around the world who have been practicing brilliant medicine.\n\nHis books are heavily referenced, but the layperson finds little difficulty in understanding his presentation of medical topics. For many years Dr. Sircus has been researching into the human condition and into the causes of disease; he has distilled many of the divergent medical systems into a new form of medicine that he has coined Natural Allopathic Medicine.\n\nNatural Allopathic Medicine represents a new therapeutic principle that revolutionizes both allopathic and naturopathic medicine offering a radical shift in medical thought and practice. Dr. Sircus’s protocol addresses foundational physiology. It focuses on pH management, cell voltage, magnesium and iodine medicine, cannabinoid medicine, carbon dioxide medicine, re-mineralization of the body, increasing oxygen transport and oxygenation of the tissues, opening up of blood vessels, saturation and healing of cells with concentrated nutrition via superfoods, breathing retraining, emotional transformation processing, detoxification and removal of heavy metals and radioactive particles.\n\nThe exciting part of Dr. Sircus’s protocol is that it is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. Secondly, with a recent medical breakthrough—a legalized form of medical marijuana now available throughout the world—Dr. Sircus’s protocol is entirely legal.\n\nWith the publication of Dr. Sircus’s Treatment Essentials book, which actually teaches people to put into practice this medical approach, anyone will now have access to the information that will enable them to take charge of their own health.\n\nDr. Sircus’s approach is humanitarian because it pays attention to the majority who cannot afford expensive medical treatments or pharmaceutical drugs. With the Natural Allopathic Medicine protocol, people with limited funds can make use of the top three medicinals mentioned above—magnesium chloride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and iodine—to inexpensively treat most health problems. Add breathing retraining, CBD, superfoods, vitamin C, plenty of water good enough to be called a medicine, enough sun, daily magnesium massages and one will improve or cure almost any ailment.\n\nVisit Website\nShow highlights:\n\nDr. Sircus tells us about how his life is becoming more spiritually focused\n“Everything we thought was stable is becoming unhinged,” according to him, so spirituality, humility, and love are important.\n\nDr. Sircus considers himself a communications psychologist.\nConflict resolution is very important.\n\n“The deeper the listening, the deeper the love,” says Dr. Sircus. He tells us about his most important relationship.\nCold kills more people than heat; the world is cooling, not warming.\n\nThe Sun is one of the strongest treatments for Coronavirus. But these “monsters” are keeping us inside.\n“Everybody’s magnesium needs have gone up in the last six months,” according to Dr. Sircus, referring to current events.\nMagnesium is the number one treatment for diabetes. It’s necessary for insulin production.\nDr. Sircus recommends magnesium bicarbonate.\nYou can easily put in two, three, four pounds of magnesium in a bath. You can add baking soda.\n\nPatrick uses 100% pharmaceutical food-grade magnesium chloride in his bath\n\nUsing clay to detoxify\n\nDr. Sircus tells us that iodine can rid the body of cornonavirus in just 4 days\nCalcium without magnesium to control it is toxic.\nDr. Sircus has a book on hydrogen.Hydrogen Medicine: Combining Oxygen with Hydrogen and CO2.\nDr. Sircus describes what’s on his website.",

He’s asked us to give you a link, as his gift to the April-May 2020 newsletter. Enjoy\n\nPresident of Henry Madison Research, Inc., Mr. Maybury is a world-renowned author, lecturer and analyst who consults with business firms and individuals in the U.S. and Europe.\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Mr. Maybury warned about a coming world war between Washington and Muslims, but few listened, just as few listened to Mitchell.\n\nEver since 9-11, thousands have been hanging on Mr. Maybury’s every word. Subscribers who have been taking his advice — to invest in things that do well in wartime — have been reaping astounding profits.\n\nMr. Maybury calls his viewpoint “Juris Naturalism,” which means the belief in a natural law that is higher than any government’s law. This, incidentally, was also the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and the other American founders.\n\n“Let me be very clear about this,” Mr. Maybury states. “I’m proud of my viewpoint and do not try to hide it behind a smokescreen of phony objectivity. I believe political power is the most evil thing humans ever discovered. It corrupts the morals and the judgment.”\n\nMr. Maybury has written 22 books and monographs, including his Uncle Eric series of books, which focus on economics, law and history. He has been interviewed on more than 250 radio and TV shows across America, on topics ranging from monetary policy, investments and business cycles to the geopolitics of the Mideast oil region and former Soviet Union, as well as U.S. foreign policy.\n\nDo not be left in the dark about changing world events and their impact on you, your money, and your family.

Murphy\nThe Theory and Brief History of the U.S. Gold Standard\nTo fully understand our current global monetary system, in which all of the major powers issue unbacked fiat money, it is helpful to learn how today’s system emerged from its earlier form. Before fiat money, all major currencies were tied (often with interruptions due to war or financial crises) to one or both of the precious metals, gold and silver. This international system of commodity-based money reached its zenith under the so-called classical gold standard, which characterized the global economy from the 1870s through the start of World War I in 1914.\n\nUnder a genuine gold standard, a nation’s monetary unit is defined as a specific weight of gold. There is “free” coinage of gold, meaning that anyone can present gold bullion to the government to be minted into gold coins of the appropriate denomination in unlimited quantities (perhaps with a small charge for the service). Going the other way, to the extent that there are paper notes or token coins issued by the government as official money, these can be presented by anyone for immediate redemption in full-bodied gold coins. Finally, under a genuine gold standard, there are no restrictions on the flow of gold into and out of the country, so that foreigners too can avail themselves of the options described above. (Continue reading article)\n\nWho was Mises?\n\nThe basic premise behind the Austrian School of Economics\n\nThe only thing keeping the market up; how does all the new money being pumped into the market work?\n\nThe fascinating history of money; defining the dollar\n\nWhy they put it in the Constitution about gold and silver coin being the real money\n\nThe times in American history when we were on the gold standard\n\nWhat was going on in 1933 when Americans were forced to turn over their gold? Americans could not own gold until 1975 after the dollar was severed from gold\n\nWho were the forces behind giving right to ownership of gold in 1975?\n\nLearn more about Robert’s work and podcast\n\nRobert P. Murphy is a Senior Fellow with the Mises Institute. He is the author of many books. His latest is Contra Krugman: Smashing the Errors of America’s Most Famous Keynesian. His other works include Chaos Theory, Lessons for the Young Economist, and Choice: Cooperation, Enterprise, and Human Action (Independent Institute, 2015) which is a modern distillation of the essentials of Mises’s thought for the layperson. Murphy is cohost, with Tom Woods, of the popular podcast Contra Krugman, which is a weekly refutation of Paul Krugman’s New York Times column. He is also host of The Bob Murphy Show.",

If he were alive today…\nWe believe he would be smiling from ear to ear. We believe he would be thrilled that so many people like yourself are interested in learning about The Gonzalez Protocol®. We believe he would be pleased at the progress our small, non-profit foundation has made to secure his legacy and the future availability of his nutritional protocol.\n\nWe know that without Dr. Gonzalez himself here to drive this work forward, his groundbreaking protocols are in danger of fading into oblivion like the brilliant work of his mentors Dr. William Donald Kelley and Dr. John Beard.\n\nPrior to his passing, Dr. Gonzalez meticulously documented the scientific theory of his work and proved its effectiveness. He believed that Nature is a Friend and not the Enemy. He published several books and recorded hundreds of hours of interviews and lectures. He wrote more than 120 in-depth patient cancer case studies — the result of a lifetime of research and groundbreaking patient care — case studies that would publicly legitimize a whole new approach to nothing less than curing cancer. All kinds of cancer.\n\nAbout Mary Swander:\n\nMary Swander is the Artistic Director of Swander Woman Productions, a theatre troupe that performs dramas about food, farming, and the wider rural environment. She is also the Executive Director of AgArts, a nonprofit designed to imagine and promote healthy food systems through the arts. Her latest book is a collection of essays on her interactions with her Amish neighbors, called Adeste Fideles in Chinese, from Route 3 Press. \n\nThe former Poet Laureate of Iowa, Swander is an award-winning author who has been given grants from the National Endowment for the Arts to the Whiting Foundation. She has published scores of books of poetry and nonfiction as well as essays, magazine articles, individual poems and radio commentaries in such places as National Public Radio, The Nation, The New York Times Magazine, and Poetry Magazine. She is best known for her poetry book Driving the Body Back and for her memoirs Out of this World and The Desert Pilgrim.\n\nShow highlights:\n\nMary starts the show talking about some problems in farming\n\nMary was a patient of Dr. Gonzalez for 20 years; He completely got rid of her fibroid uterine tumors\n\nThe biggest lifestyle change he recommended; vegetarian diets don’t work for all patients\n\nMary Swander was so curious to understand how an Ivy League trained doctor found the more alternative path\n\nMary explains Dr. Gonzalez’ basic program\n\nThe patients with the most success followed the program in detail\n\nWhy coffee enemas are so important in the program",

            "description": "Jackie Jura\nCreator of the Website Orwell Today\nCOVID: MASK OF THE BEAST\n\n“And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\nto wear a mask on their face below their foreheads:\nAnd that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mask.”\n~ adaptation from Book of Revelation\n\n“Beware the ides of March” wrote Shakespeare four hundred years ago — which in Roman times meant around March 15th which was the day Julius Ceasar was assassinated two thousand years ago. “Beware the ides of March” is a common expression nowadays and many people do tend to avoid putting themselves in risky situations on that day, ie postpone surgery, don’t fly etc. And often it is true that disasterous events happen during the ides of March — and this year, 2020, it was the official arrival of the invasion of the fake COVID pandemic war on America. The president of the USA banned Europeans from entering the country and the prime minister of Canada told travellers to come home before the borders closed.\n\nI was in Mexico where I’d been for two and a half months and planning to stay until early April when the COVID bomb was dropped. People were streaming out of hotels — luggage was piled up waiting to be loaded into taxis and vans — it was mass exodus and I was part of it. On March 14th I phoned my airline and after being on hold for a couple of hours got my ticket changed to two days hence — March 16th.\n\nI wasn’t leaving Mexico because of fear of ‘catching COVID’. I’d already pegged the so-called pandemic as another Orwellian staged event which had been playing out since January ie everyone making jokes about being locked up for sneezing or coughing as was happening in countries around the world with mandatory self-isolation rules. I even adapted the WHO FLU SARS POEM I’d written in 2003 for that wanna-be pandemic.\n\nI wanted to get home before Canada started placing restrictions on return-travel, ie “get a vaccine or you don’t get back into the country”. I knew — from researching Orwellian conspiracy theories all these years — that a vaccine injecting disease and a tracking device was the ultimate goal of the powers-that-be behind the COVID-19 plan/scam/panic-demic.\n\nVaccines containing a microchip had been the talk of the world for years ever since Microsoft’s Bill Gates started bragging about using a pandemic — “microbes, not missiles” — to force a vaccine — “the 666 Mark of the Beast” — into the body of every human being on the planet. To add insult to injury — and because they ‘get off’ on rubbing our noses in their evil defecation — the Microsoft patent application for their artificial intelligence device is “666”, ie WO 2020/O6/O6/06 AI”.\n\nThe biggest name in opposition to Gates — and to Gates’ partner in crime, WHO — is Robert F Kennedy Jr, son of Bobby and nephew of JFK — who has put his life on the line to speak out against and warn the world about the global conspiracy of forced vaccination under the pretense of a global pandemic — COVID-19. (READ MORE)\n\nShow highlights:\n\nThe background of the novel 1984 and George Orwell\n\nThe Conspiracy for World Domination\n\nAnimal Farm was written as a fairy tale so it would be published\n\nCorporate communism is what we are experiencing\n\nEverything said today is exactly the opposite, just as Orwell said it would be\n\nJackie talks about the 4th horseman of the apocalypse\n\nBill Gate’s vaccine program has killed and injured many children in Africa and India\n\nPoliticians who can’t be “owned” are killed\n\n666 from the book of Revelation in the Bible\n\nHow Covid-19 got it’s name\n\nJackie tells us what she thinks the COVID-19 vaccine will entale\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is the #1 man standing up against the vaccine agenda\n\nJFK wanted to completely dismantle the CIA\n\nAssassinating the character of all the Kennedys\n\nTurning people into animals\n\nJackie has never worn a mask in a store; she simply says, “I’m exempt”",

It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools, but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches; praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it’s mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath.\n\nIt is sneaky. It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl’s but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic. It can’t spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but it can’t survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe.\n\nIt is the most curious thing, how it lives on basketballs, baseball bats and ballet bars, but dies on WWE ropes and Walmart shopping carts. It is spread by hair stylists, dog groomers, and dentists, but not by bank tellers, cashiers, and fast food workers.\n\nIt’s so smart. It won’t bother the first 10 people gathered but it knows when the 11th person shows up, so be careful if that’s you.! It even knows what you want vs. what you need. If you want a massage or your nails done it is very actively on the prowl and not even a mask can stop it, but if you need a plumber, it is weak, and a mask will keep it away. It also seems to be most dangerous after 5:30pm so businesses must start to close before the virus comes out of hiding and wreaks havoc upon the populations. It also requires dine-in restaurants to have a shorter menu and you use real plates but only plastic forks and spoons.\n\nWhoever heard of such a clever, sneaky virus?!?\n\nAuthor Unknown",

Dr. Sircus’s methods are based on medical science and long years of clinical experience, not only his own but experiences of doctors from around the world who have been practicing brilliant medicine.\n\nHis books are heavily referenced, but the layperson finds little difficulty in understanding his presentation of medical topics. For many years Dr. Sircus has been researching into the human condition and into the causes of disease; he has distilled many of the divergent medical systems into a new form of medicine that he has coined Natural Allopathic Medicine.\n\nNatural Allopathic Medicine represents a new therapeutic principle that revolutionizes both allopathic and naturopathic medicine offering a radical shift in medical thought and practice. Dr. Sircus’s protocol addresses foundational physiology. It focuses on pH management, cell voltage, magnesium and iodine medicine, cannabinoid medicine, carbon dioxide medicine, re-mineralization of the body, increasing oxygen transport and oxygenation of the tissues, opening up of blood vessels, saturation and healing of cells with concentrated nutrition via superfoods, breathing retraining, emotional transformation processing, detoxification and removal of heavy metals and radioactive particles.\n\nThe exciting part of Dr. Sircus’s protocol is that it is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. Secondly, with a recent medical breakthrough—a legalized form of medical marijuana now available throughout the world—Dr. Sircus’s protocol is entirely legal.\n\nWith the publication of Dr. Sircus’s Treatment Essentials book, which actually teaches people to put into practice this medical approach, anyone will now have access to the information that will enable them to take charge of their own health.\n\nDr. Sircus’s approach is humanitarian because it pays attention to the majority who cannot afford expensive medical treatments or pharmaceutical drugs. With the Natural Allopathic Medicine protocol, people with limited funds can make use of the top three medicinals mentioned above—magnesium chloride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and iodine—to inexpensively treat most health problems. Add breathing retraining, CBD, superfoods, vitamin C, plenty of water good enough to be called a medicine, enough sun, daily magnesium massages and one will improve or cure almost any ailment.\n\nVisit Website\nShow highlights:\n\nThe benefits of sun gazing at sunrise and sunset\nThe imagination is the ability to visualize and create\nWitnessing a new form of medical terrorism in the world\nHealth authorities advising what to do although they do not know what to do themselves\nWhy they tell us to look at the “data” regarding Covid and not the “science”\nIn Chinese medicine, the heart is the supreme commander\nEverything we think or feel is reflected in the heart\nIncreasing oxygen as an independent variable can be dangerous\nThe beauty of the E watt system is your increasing CO2 and you can sustain high levels of oxygen\nBreathing is triggered by the need to get rid of CO2\nWhy do you get disease in any part of the body?\nCold hands/ feet from lack of circulation\nOxygen therapy\nHydrogen has an effect on every cell because of its small size\nHydrogen and CO2 make oxygen safe\nThe lower your oxygen goes down, the sicker you get\nWhat is the best water in the world to drink?\nWhat could you add to distilled water in the form of minerals?\nThere’s a way at looking at cancer as a survival mechanism",

Atom’s journey towards health, nutrition, longevity, and meditation goes back to 1955, when he first started reading books by D.C. Jarvis, J.I. Rodale, Carlton Fredericks, Adelle Davis, Aldous Huxley, Paramahansa Yogananda, Swami Prabhavananda, and numerous others. His exposure to the above mentioned authors instigated a deep desire and passion to understand and unlock the secrets to optimal human wellness and longevity. Atom was inspired by the words of Thomas Jefferson: “School teaches all of the branches, but none of the roots.” He sought the answers to his questions, not in classrooms, but in books, relationships, and life experiences. His quest for true knowledge and wisdom began by studying in hundreds of libraries across the country and evolved by studying with teachers and masters including Swami Adano Ley, Sufi Adnan Sarhan, Rabbi Michael Shapiro, Taoist Master Yun Xiang Tseng, and Fitness Icon Gypsy Boots. His most significant teacher was Swami Adano Ley with whom he spent 14 years. During this time, he studied a variety of sciences extensively, including the sun centric lifestyle, and ultimately graduated from Adano Ley’s Texas Institute of Reflex Sciences. The knowledge and wisdom he gained studying under a highly evolved swami combined with his emphasis on scientific research & personal experience would soon become the heartbeat of Sun Sync Nutrition. For the past 40 years, Atom has dedicated his life to the continuous learning and teaching of Sun Sync Nutrition, Time Conscious Eating, Cosmo-Chemistry, Reflexology, Muscle Response Testing, Body Language Analysis, Iris Analysis, Lucid Dreaming,\n\nYour organs age at a different rate\nEach sound has an area that goes into the body\nThe idea of drinking a cobalomin tonic at liver detox time\nCharcoal good for detoxing, but potentially dangerous if taken everyday\nThe idea behind meditating at 3 am\nWhat goes on with the carbon dioxide and blood when we breathe through our mouths vs. nose?\nMeasuring emotional states through finger pressure\nBeing able to become invisible\nUsing Covid testing to collect DNA\nWhat would have happened if we treated Covid like a common cold or flu?\nThe Nordic mythologies of the root language\nUsing weighted or unweighted tuning forks on your body\nWe don’t get our karma until 3 years of age\nLooking at the body language of Mark Zuckerburg\nDial feedback could be set up to do mind hacking\nCausing an electrical current and ruining your teeth with gold fillings\nWhat are Atom’s top recommendations for slowing down aging?\n2 hours and 40 minutes a day to begin meditation\nTypes of meditation\nAlmond oil to regrow hair?\nThe body is an upside down tree\nYour hand is your conscious mind; your feet is your unconscious mind\nDisease is lying to yourself\nThe benefits of orange juice\nRecommendations for correcting peripheral neuropathy in the feet\nCarbon dioxide acidifies you; baking soda alkalizes you\nAI and nanotechnology\nPower is in the gun not the gold\nA perfect solar meal: strawberries in milk with sugar\n\nSolar Timing\nAtom’s Blog\nSun Sync Nutrition",

            "description": "Richard Maybury\nFounder of The Early Warning Report\nRichard Maybury is widely regarded as one of the top free-market writers in America. His articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and other major publications.\n\nRichard Maybury publishes one of the most well respected newsletters on investing in the World: Early Warning Report. He’s asked us to give you a link, as his gift to the April-May 2020 newsletter. Enjoy\n\nPresident of Henry Madison Research, Inc., Mr. Maybury is a world-renowned author, lecturer and analyst who consults with business firms and individuals in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMr. Maybury is often compared to General Billy Mitchell. You may remember that Mitchell foretold the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; he was one of those rare individuals with the amazing knack for seeing through the “conventional wisdom” and political smoke screens, to spot crucial new trends – the kind that catch most other experts by surprise.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Mr. Maybury warned about a coming world war between Washington and Muslims, but few listened, just as few listened to Mitchell.\n\nEver since 9-11, thousands have been hanging on Mr. Maybury’s every word. Subscribers who have been taking his advice — to invest in things that do well in wartime — have been reaping astounding profits.\n\nMr. Maybury calls his viewpoint “Juris Naturalism,” which means the belief in a natural law that is higher than any government’s law. This, incidentally, was also the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and the other American founders.\n\n“Let me be very clear about this,” Mr. Maybury states. “I’m proud of my viewpoint and do not try to hide it behind a smokescreen of phony objectivity. I believe political power is the most evil thing humans ever discovered. It corrupts the morals and the judgment.”\n\nMr. Maybury has written 22 books and monographs, including his Uncle Eric series of books, which focus on economics, law and history. He has been interviewed on more than 250 radio and TV shows across America, on topics ranging from monetary policy, investments and business cycles to the geopolitics of the Mideast oil region and former Soviet Union, as well as U.S. foreign policy.\n\nDo not be left in the dark about changing world events and their impact on you, your money, and your family. Know what others don’t, and subscribe to U.S. & World Early Warning Report today.\n\nEthics Solutions\nVisit Website\n\nShow Highlights:\n\nSchools are socialist institutions\nCommunism is just the end stage of socialism\nIt was during the cold war when people started confusing socialism and communism\nThe early Americans were not fighting for democracy, they were fighting for liberty\nThere us no American founder that believed in democracy\nWhat is political power and how does it warp people’s minds?\nWhat sets government apart from all other institutions\nVelocity is the speed at which money trades hands; the more velocity of money the more of the effect it has on price\nWhen a vaccine comes out, you will see a wave of euphoria go through the investment market\nIf people get afraid of the currency, they will go out and spend it immediately\nThe central banks sit on huge amounts of gold and can drive the price down\nCensorship on social media\nThere’s almost no free markets anymore\nThere’s a very big difference in investing in an ipo and investing in the secondary market\nAre there opportunities to invest during Covid?\nIn the department of health and human services, the inspector general wanted to launch an investigation to where the money from Covid is actually going; she is no longer the inspector general\n\nWhat kind of forces are behind Covid and what motivations are there to drive the economy into the ground?\n\nIs a global currency reset possible?\nThe Federal Reserve is just a big accounting scam that allows the government to rack up debt that it can never pay back\n\nThe government has become too big to slap down and is destroying our society",

Click here to read Case Studies.\n\nKST may be used to locate and address areas that need attention such as meridians, acupuncture points, trigger points, energy “cysts”, emotional issues, allergies, phobias, addictions, bad habits, toxicity, structural imbalances, visceral stresses, disc problems and much more. Such issues can often be corrected easily and quickly to improve body function.\n\nHealthcare professionals from many different disciplines are using KST to improve their effectiveness. That includes Doctors of Chiropractic, practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncturists, Doctors of Osteopathy, dentists, Doctors of Naturopathy, CranioSacral Therapists, massage therapists, body workers of all kinds, Medical Doctors and others to find areas of stress, interference, etc. they had missed in the past.\n\n(The application of correction procedures is, of course, dependent upon and limited to the individual’s knowledge and legal permission [licenses, etc.] to work on others.)\n\nKST practitioners often report that in addition to improved clinical results, patient retention increases as practice satisfaction and excitement grow.\n\nEveryone is different – healing is non-linear – patient uniqueness needs to be respected; that is one of the most powerful features of KST.  Instead of relying upon a limited mechanistic or intellectual model of care, KST approaches every patient in a unique, vitalistic, non-linear manner.\n\nAs an added benefit with KST you can work on yourself.\n\nVisit website\n\nShow highlights:\n\nDr. Koren shares his story of being damaged by medical treatments when he was young; He also suffered a concussion and bodily injury from a piece of furniture falling on him which led to 10 years of living with severe pain\n\nHe came up with a technique to banish the pain for good\n\nThis technique healed his wife’s migraines\n\nHe’s taught over 4000 people to do this work\n\nDr. Koren’s research has shown that during the Spanish flu, the people died of bacterial pneumonia, not the flu, due to the overuse of aspirin. Aspirin was new and it was overused which prevented the body from being able to generate a fever\n\nCancer is natural, so is the cure. Tumors are created to sequester and store toxic wastes.

            "description": "GS Youngblood\nAuthor of The Masculine in Relationship: A Blueprint for Inspiring the Trust, Lust, and Devotion of a Strong Woman\nMen today want to feel more powerful in their relationship. Especially those with a strong woman.\n\nSuch a woman doesn’t settle for mediocre.  She needs you to consistently follow through on your word, have purpose in life, remain grounded in the face of her intense emotion, make her feel safe, and provide leadership in the relationship.\n\nWhen that doesn’t happen, she may start to drift.  Things between you will start to feel flat, contentious, or even toxic.  To you, she will seem to nag and criticize more, and have less interest in sex.  When she gets really angry, you’ll label it as “crazy” and blame her.\n\nBut, in truth, she’s just expressing the pain of you not stepping up.  It is a relationship arc that is all too common.  \n\nFighting or defending yourself doesn’t resolve anything.  Withdrawing into work or your phone makes it worse.  And contorting yourself to avoid conflict just kills her respect for you.\n\nThe answer is to develop and live from your Masculine core. \n\nI coach men in relationship. I help you see yourself more clearly. I help you bring more leadership to your relationship in support of creating more ease, play, sexuality, respect, and attraction.\n\nThe nature of my work is laid out in my book The Masculine in Relationship: A Blueprint for Inspiring the Trust, Lust, and Devotion of a Strong Woman.

            "description": "Dr. Mark Sircus\nHigh Performance Health \nDr. Mark Sircus, Ac., OMD, DM (P) (acupuncturist, doctor of oriental and pastoral medicine) is a prolific writer and author of some astounding medical and health-related books. Dr. Sircus’s methods are based on medical science and long years of clinical experience, not only his own but experiences of doctors from around the world who have been practicing brilliant medicine.\n\nHis books are heavily referenced, but the layperson finds little difficulty in understanding his presentation of medical topics. For many years Dr. Sircus has been researching into the human condition and into the causes of disease; he has distilled many of the divergent medical systems into a new form of medicine that he has coined Natural Allopathic Medicine.\n\nNatural Allopathic Medicine represents a new therapeutic principle that revolutionizes both allopathic and naturopathic medicine offering a radical shift in medical thought and practice. Dr. Sircus’s protocol addresses foundational physiology. It focuses on pH management, cell voltage, magnesium and iodine medicine, cannabinoid medicine, carbon dioxide medicine, re-mineralization of the body, increasing oxygen transport and oxygenation of the tissues, opening up of blood vessels, saturation and healing of cells with concentrated nutrition via superfoods, breathing retraining, emotional transformation processing, detoxification and removal of heavy metals and radioactive particles.\n\nThe exciting part of Dr. Sircus’s protocol is that it is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. Secondly, with a recent medical breakthrough—a legalized form of medical marijuana now available throughout the world—Dr. Sircus’s protocol is entirely legal.\n\nWith the publication of Dr. Sircus’s Treatment Essentials book, which actually teaches people to put into practice this medical approach, anyone will now have access to the information that will enable them to take charge of their own health.\n\nDr. Sircus’s approach is humanitarian because it pays attention to the majority who cannot afford expensive medical treatments or pharmaceutical drugs. With the Natural Allopathic Medicine protocol, people with limited funds can make use of the top three medicinals mentioned above—magnesium chloride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and iodine—to inexpensively treat most health problems. Add breathing retraining, CBD, superfoods, vitamin C, plenty of water good enough to be called a medicine, enough sun, daily magnesium massages and one will improve or cure almost any ailment.\n\nVisit Website\nShow highlights:\n\nOxygen levels and CO2 levels underneath masks\nSpiritually we have gone so far into separation we can no longer go into conversation\nA person’s ability to accept and deal with life’s difficulties separates healthy minds from sick minds\nWorking on love and forgiveness\nIs there any science that shows wearing a mask is effective?\nDoes Dr. Sircus believe there is a virus (man-made or otherwise) that is out here?\nAs the infection rates are going up, the death rate has gone down\nAre the death rates reported from Covid inaccurate?\nForced vaccination\nViruses are not simply independent things that hit us like trucks\nViruses and the flu tend to come from the inside out\nEffects of breathing Brown’s Gas\nMulti-step oxygen therapy\nThe sicker you are, the more hydrogen you need\nIf you’re healthy, hydrogen works like an anti-aging medicine\nHydrogen stimulates oxidation\nMagnesium is the lamp of life\nMagnesium is a great ICU and ambulance medicine\nWe are totally dependent on the banks and money\nThe end stage of everything that is going on currently is the collapse of the dollar and a one world currency\n$300 trillion in debt in a collapsing economy is a recipe for disaster\nShould people take their cash out of the bank?",

            "description": "Adronis is the name given to the multidimensional consciousness channeled through Brad Johnson. The channeling of Adronis began in December of 2008 where Brad was introduced to the energy of Adronis through the process of “automatic writing.” Adronis identified himself as a fifth-density humanoid consciousness existing within the star system of “Sirius A.” Throughout Adronis’ communications, he has shared that his intentions are to be of service to humanity by sharing his knowledge and wisdom through Brad as a channeling conduit. In Adronis’ specific meaning, “as Brad spiritually evolves, he will allow others to spiritually evolve with him through my interactions.”\n\nBrad moved deeper into vocally channeling Adronis in 2009. Since that time, the connection to Adronis has become more pure and channelings have emerged with a greater depth of information. Individuals has been amazed by how much personal and general information can be shared through Adronis as Brad channels him consciously.\n\nAfter December 21st, 2012, Brad decided to take a break with channeling Adronis for several months so that he could better integrate his ability of Conscious Matrix Communication. Around the Spring of 2013, Adronis returned as Brad communicated with him again as the energies of contact were strong on both sides to continue. Through the return of channeling Adronis, his energy had felt very different. Adronis has shared that he is now communicating through Brad as a sixth-density Sirian consciousness existing within the star of Sirius A itself where he is composed entirely of starlight.\n\nShortly after this reintegration of Adronis, Brad was able to discover another contact that could best be represented as Adronis’ feminine counterpart. This being referred to herself as RaYaR: Singer of Sirius Light. Throughout her transmissions, language of light chants have emerged through Brad’s channeling. RaYaR represents an additional component to Adronis to offer further depth to the channeling experience to provide an illuminating feminine energy through the dialogues. (READ MORE)",

For the past four decades, she has led a national, grassroots movement and public information campaign to institute vaccine safety and informed consent protections in public health policies and laws. She has researched, analyzed and publicly articulated the science, policy, law, ethics and politics of vaccination to become one of the world’s leading non-medical, consumer advocacy experts on vaccination and human rights.\n\nShe is co-author of the seminal book DPT: A Shot in the Dark (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 1985; Warner 1986; Avery/Putnam 1991) and author of The Guide to Reforming Vaccine Policy & Law (2014, 2017); The Emerging Risks of Live Virus and Virus Vectored Vaccines: Vaccine Strain Virus Infection, Shedding and Transmission (2014); Vaccines, Autism & Chronic Inflammation: The New Epidemic (2008) and The Consumer’s Guide to Childhood Vaccines (1997). She is founder and executive editor of the weekly online journal, The Vaccine Reaction, and a video blog commentator for the NVIC Newsletter and Mercola Newsletter. Her long public record of vaccine safety and choice advocacy was featured in the 2011 award winning film documentary THE GREATER GOOD.\n\nHer 1985 book, DPT: A Shot in the Dark, which she co-authored with Harris Coulter, Ph.D., was the first major, well documented critique of America’s mass vaccination system calling for safety reforms and the human right to informed consent to vaccination. She worked with Congress to secure vaccine safety provisions in the historic National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 and has served as a consumer representative on federal vaccine advisory and public engagement committees, including the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (1988-1991); the Institute of Medicine Vaccine Safety Forum (1995-1998) where she helped coordinate five public workshops on vaccine safety issues; the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (1999-2002); the Vaccine Policy Analysis Collaborative (2002-2005); and the Vaccine Safety Writing Group (2009).\n\nShe has testified in Congress and state legislatures on vaccine policy and law and has provided a series of written and oral public comments on vaccine science and policy issues for federal and state health agencies.

In this scholarly work of a heretofore neglected aspect of America’s costliest conflict, Jack Graham’s findings on the real reason for the War Between the States will challenge conventional thought. Not for the delicate sensibilities of the politically correct, Mr. Graham’s conclusions will disturb some and infuriate others, but students of the war with the guts and gumption to peruse it will be amply rewarded. Exhaustively researched, lavishly footnoted, meticulously examined, impeccably analyzed, astonishing in conclusion, Graham’s obvious gift of analysis will impress the reader and his conclusions will astound even the most dedicated students of the so-called Civil War. Intellectual in style, yet fluid and highly readable, the evidence Graham brings into the court of public opinion is irrefutable and demands a verdict.

            "description": "Saving the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Would Undermine Democracy\nThe 2016 election caused many pundits and citizens alike to decry the Electoral College. This book explains the dangerous and unconstitutional implications of the National Popular Vote Bill, which is quietly passing in state houses across the nation.\n\nEver since the Founding Fathers created the Electoral College, Congress has tried to overturn it. The latest attempt is taking place not in Congress, but in state legislatures around the country, where a well-financed campaign by a private California group calling itself “National Popular Vote” (NPV) is proposing an “interstate compact” to circumvent the process for amending the U.S. Constitution. If adopted by states representing a majority of electoral votes, the signatory states would bind themselves to ignore the popular votes within their respective states, and instead allocate their electoral votes to the candidate whom the media proclaimed to be the “national popular vote” winner.\n\nIn this new history of the Electoral College, law professor Robert M. Hardaway lays bare the constitutional loopholes that have allowed this movement to succeed in states representing approximately half the electoral votes necessary to purportedly bind those states to ignore the popular vote of the people within their respective states. The presentation of the information in this book to state legislatures considering the compact, resulted in complete reversal of preconceived perceptions about how presidential elections should be conducted.\n\n\n• Exposes the National Popular Vote movement, which seeks to abolish the Electoral College, by making readers aware of this its agenda, financing, and goal of effectively amending the constitutional process by a means that takes place under the radar of the general public\n\n• Presents as succinctly and clearly as possible the dubious constitutional grounds for the Compact, as well as the ramifications if it were to somehow be approved by the U.S. Supreme Court\n\n• Illustrates exactly how this movement is succeeding in state after state precisely because the public is uninformed about the Electoral College\n\n• Shows how the abolition of the Electoral College and inauguration of a national “popular vote” would actually result in an outcome that is contrary to the goals of many of its supporters\n\nShow highlights:\n\nMost students on college campuses don’t really understand how elections work nor what the Electoral College is all about\n\nIn order to abolish the Electoral College, all States must agree\n\nProf. Hardaway explains why the Electoral College is fair\n\nWhat is the NPVIC?\n\nThe recount in FL in the 2000 elections\n\nWhy do we have an Electoral College?\n\nThe grand compromise that created our nation",

Internationally known for her empowering approach to women’s health and wellness, Dr. Northrup teaches women how to thrive at every stage of life.\n\nA board-certified OB/GYN physician, Dr. Northrup graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and completed her residency at Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston. She was also an assistant clinical professor of OB/GYN at Maine Medical Center for 20 years.\n\nDr. Northrup knows that the key to vibrant health on all levels is within us—our inner wisdom. She says, “When we find the connection between our thoughts, beliefs, physical health, and life circumstances, we find that we are in the driver’s seat of our lives and can make profound changes. Nothing is more exhilarating or empowering.”\n\nShow highlights:\n\nChristiane tells us why she chose to be an OB/GYN\n\nDr. Northrup had always had a sense that the medical system was off on their protocols for healing\n\nWe don’t allow women to labor naturally; why is having a baby treated as a medical emergency?\n\nHow the Law of Attraction figures into the way a woman labors? How fear affects labor\n\nFight, flight, or freeze: These are the things mainstream media sells us\n\nAnytime people are in prolonged states of fear and panic, the immune system weakens\n\nThe information coming out of the CDC, WHO, and the AMA is totally upside down, but it’s no wonder because they are all in bed with the drug/vaccine companies\n\nThere are ways to make vaccines safer, but they would be very cheap. No one could get rich from doing things the right and safe way\n\nThe only cases of polio now are actually from vaccines\n\nOur goal should be obtaining naturally enhanced immunity with vitamin C & D, and Zinc\n\ngrassrootshealth.net\n\nThe problem with wearing masks during this COVID crisis\n\nForced vaccination will be fought and won in the courts",

            "description": "Richard Maybury is widely regarded as one of the top free-market writers in America. His articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and other major publications.\n\nRichard Maybury publishes one of the most well respected newsletters on investing in the World: Early Warning Report. He’s asked us to give you a link, as his gift to the April-May 2020 newsletter. Enjoy\n\nPresident of Henry Madison Research, Inc., Mr. Maybury is a world-renowned author, lecturer and analyst who consults with business firms and individuals in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMr. Maybury is often compared to General Billy Mitchell. You may remember that Mitchell foretold the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; he was one of those rare individuals with the amazing knack for seeing through the “conventional wisdom” and political smoke screens, to spot crucial new trends – the kind that catch most other experts by surprise.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Mr. Maybury warned about a coming world war between Washington and Muslims, but few listened, just as few listened to Mitchell.\n\nEver since 9-11, thousands have been hanging on Mr. Maybury’s every word. Subscribers who have been taking his advice — to invest in things that do well in wartime — have been reaping astounding profits.\n\nMr. Maybury calls his viewpoint “Juris Naturalism,” which means the belief in a natural law that is higher than any government’s law. This, incidentally, was also the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and the other American founders.\n\nMr. Maybury has written 22 books and monographs, including his Uncle Eric series of books, which focus on economics, law and history. He has been interviewed on more than 250 radio and TV shows across America, on topics ranging from monetary policy, investments and business cycles to the geopolitics of the Mideast oil region and former Soviet Union, as well as U.S. foreign policy.\n\nIn the realm of geopolitics, Mr. Maybury’s insights come not only from a great deal of education, both formal and self-taught, but also from hard experience. During the Vietnam War, he was in the Air Force’s 605th Air Commando Squadron, a special operations unit involved in covert warfare in Central and South America. He was a crewmember on AC-47 gunships, and C-46, C-47 and C-141 transport planes, and helped train scores of the CIA’s foreign troops from the notorious School of the Americas. He learned firsthand the truth of Senator Hiram Johnson’s remark that the first casualty when war comes is truth.\n\nDo not be left in the dark about changing world events and their impact on you, your money, and your family. Know what others don’t, and subscribe to U.S. & World Early Warning Report today.\n\nVisit Website\n\nShow highlights:\n\nBy the end of the century, socialism had taken hold of the intellectuals\nFree market vs. socialism\nThe difference between socialists in the 1800’s and now\nThe movement from “one room school houses” to “assembly line schools”\nThe government causes most of the problems that people have nowadays\nGovernment is just a way to “rob Peter to subsidize Paul”\nPeople making individual decisions is what causes the economy to change\nWhen people look at economics as equations and machines, you loose the freedom that should be there\nThe German Miracle\nGovernment controls are stopping people from going back to work since Covid\nIf you look at the statistics of Covid, the statistics are unreliable and overstated\n“The use of the word pandemic is so misleading” for our current situation\nExcept in the hot spots, Covid should not even be considered an epidemic\nThe speed at which money circulates has as much effect on the price of things as the quantity of money does\n\nand so much more!",

The law was only specific to smallpox, and for a small fee (maybe large in 1905), the dude could have extricated himself.  In other words, he had a remedy.  Also, the court pointed out that Jacobson showed no evidence that vaccination would seriously impair his health or probably cause his death.

On April 18, Dr. Fauci (whose close ties with Bill Gates, and Big Pharma have much to do with his control of hundreds of billions of dollars of research money), stated:\n\n“There was a study recently that we can make available to you, where a group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences there and the sequences in bats as they evolve. And the mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human.”\n\nI think at this moment, rife as it is with speculative arguments, confusion and under-defined data, it is useful to remove oneself from the present and look for higher reference points from which we can re-evaluate events now unfolding on the world stage.\n\nIn order to do this, let us begin by asking a new series of questions:\n\nWhat is Nature Magazine exactly? Is it truly an “objective” platform for pure scientific research untainted by the filth of political agendas? Is this standard-bearer of “proper method”, which can make or break the career of any scientist, truly the scientific journal it claims to be or is there something darker to be discovered?\n\nAs I presented a part of this story in my previous instalment in this series The Rise of Optical Biophysics and Clash of the Two Sciences, a very old battle has been waged around political systems but also what sort of scientific paradigms will shape our future. (continue reading)\n\nMatthew is a journalist and co-founder of the Rising Tide Foundation and Canadian Patriot Review. He has published scientific articles with 21st Century Science and Technology, and is a regular author on several political/cultural websites including Los Angeles Review of Books: China Channel, Strategic Culture, Off Guardian and The Duran.

George explains this when answering this question: Good morning all! We have an AquaCure and would like a refresher on the breathing. When does a body reach saturation while breathing and how long does it stay in the body and do its good stuff? Is more breathing better, or is there a maximum?\n\nStories of how hydrogen has eased COVID-19 symptoms helping those affected to breathe easier\n\nChanging our DNA with our thoughts\n\nGeorge addresses a concern from a listener who bought an Aquacure machine:  I bought the Aquacure, and have since seen a few other people who bought one as well.  They have videos online sharing the differences between the Aquacure and others.  One guy talks about how toxins are in the water with the Acquacure and how it is not a good idea.  Another guy uses the machine and promotes it and has added another two containers of water the gas goes through.  This has had me very concerned.\n\nQuestion from a listener: Can using a $200 Hydrogen water machine have any effect, at least as a stop gap until we can buy one of yours? \n\nGeorge springs a surprise 20% off sale thru May 27th\n\nQuestion from a listener: Last year you mentioned a new protocol using the AC50 to create New Water. Are you still planning to release that and if so, when can we expect it?\n\nQuestion from a listener: Dr Cowen states deuterium is not good. Deuterium is an isotope of the hydrogen atom that occurs naturally in water. Does the AquaCure have any concern with this?\n\nGeorge gives a good word of warning about sleeping with the hydrogen machine @ 100% when answering this question: I have been using  AquaCure for a month. I have plenty  of scars and have not seen anything change .Am I missing something or doing something wrong. Sleeping with hydrogen at 100%\n\nCan drinking bubbled distilled water affect the body’s pH as tested via urine?\n\nQuestion from a listener: Lets say I breathe the brown’s gas, then stop for moment but will do later, does it help to release the pressure (loosen knob) and turn off machine or just keep knob tight and keep on. Does it matter in terms of longevity of the Aquacure?\n\nQuestion from a listener: Can I hook it up to my cpap machine to breathe it at night?\n\nQuestion from a listener: I’m getting near the 200 hr point. Can I use a plastic tub to empty the lye water into? Or should it be glass?\n\n\nWorld authority on Molecular Hydrogen and Brown’s Gas on the super antioxidant properties and more benefits from this cutting edge technology, May 12, 2020",

I’ve been watching a class on Fatty Liver, and those health professionals seem to think it is a miracle substance.\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid info\n\nIdeas for flyers concerned about the new novel coronavirus\n\nDoes mouth breathing add opposed to noise breathing change the pH of the blood?\n\nFrom a listener: Atom credits oranges with helping him stay healthy. Wondering if he would care to tell us how oranges have helped him? \nBecause of him, I am now eating at least 1 orange daily around 10am. A severe gut pain that I’ve had for months has finally gone away as soon as I started eating them.\nI am sleeping better at night and remembering my dreams. Sometimes I eat grapefruit at 10am instead. Does that still do the trick?\nI wonder how oranges made my gut pain disappear.. Dr Daniels says citrus helps digest fat..could that be what’s happening?\n\nand so much more!!",

She says that if the decline continues, within the next 10-20, life will cease to exist\n\nJudy believes that all the cancer in pets is caused by all the glyphosates found in dog foods and from people spraying their lawns\n\nWe discuss how she uses Hyland's cell salts for reversing deformities in animals. She shares a story of a young child with facial deformities that were given the remedies by her mother thus transforming her face.\n\nListener comment on Judy Hoy's work: A friend fell off her roof onto rocks while she was power washing. Her ankle suffered multiple fractures and she was put in a boot. I put her on Judy's Calc-Phos and Bioplasma. Her ankle healed so quickly that she walked into the docs office holding her boot rather than wearing it. Nurses and docs freaked out that she was endangering the bone...UNTIL...x-rays proved an early perfect healing ...way before the expected required time. Judy Hoy is a brilliant woman.This story is just one example of how I've used her recipe to heal animals and people.\n\nWe learn how Judy defied the odds when given her pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis; she has lived and thrived with her lung issues for 22+ years\n\nQuestion from a listener: The observation of Mrs. Hoy lead her to believe that agricultural pollutants are causing malformation of bone development. If this is because calcium or magnesium become poorly absorbed and utilized, does she think that Vitamin D plays a role here? Does she advise high amounts of Vitamin D? What does Mrs. Hoy think about airborne pollution blocking certain portions of sunlight that are needed for vitamin D production, calcium absorption and other vital bodily functions?",

People have no idea what's really going on. Why won't mainstream media touch this subject. The John Birch Society is the only organization who talks about this subject and names names\n\nWhat is The New World Order and who is behind it?

Trump\n\nThere is probably close to 40 million illegals in this country; the problem with mass immigration\n\nStop the Globalists Trade Agenda\n\nThe agenda is to place all the power in the U.N.; there's never been a head of the U.N. that wasn't a Socialist or Communist\n\nWe talk about a bit about climate change; just another scheme to get us involved in a one world government\n\nHear why Mr. Thompson makes a comparison between Trump and Kennedy\n\nThe CIA has been propagandizing the American people for years\n\nWhy Mr. Thompson doesn't ever trust someone who is a Rhodes scholar\n\n!976 was the target, for the most part, to take down America. Why didn't it happen?

What is learned helplessness?\n\nDr. Peat talks free will vs. determinism\n\nWhen women get older, what are the symptoms of low progesterone?\n\nWhat does Dr. Peat think of titanium ceramic non-stick cookware? Glassware is the best to cook in\n\nCould you live on just milk? Technically yes, but you would become iron deficient\n\nCause of vertigo\n\nHere's the book that Dr. Peat recommends we all read \n\nhttps://archive.org/details/carbonicacidinme00rose/page/n7\n\nAnd just some of the many emails asked and answered:\nQuestion for Ray Peat. What is the mechanism for how proper thyroid function and stomach acid break down or neutralize oxalates in the diet. Does it matter how much oxalic acid is consumed? Also, how effective are mineral compounds like magnesium or potassium citrate at preventing the negative effects of oxalic acid.\n\nYou recommend 2000 mg Calcium per day  ----  a concern expressed by other nutritionists is that the calcium may not go into the bones, but into the soft tissue and other places causing systemic damage over time.   If one does take your suggestion: what are other prerequisite actions or physiological cell metabolism assumptions you are making? For example, are you assuming the person takes Vitamin D, Vitamin K and has proper thyroid function which stimulates production of adequate CO2 (which apparently takes calcium out of the cell).  Please  explain in detail so I can understand your recommendation in proper context.",

            "description": "A wide variety of subjects were dance with on this show with Atom, such as:\n\ntoday you are the man in black, but when Atom comes on you should wear the proper solar color shirt for the day!    \n\nDr. William Beaumont (the Father of Gastric Physiology) experimented with the hole in Alexis St. Martin's stomach for well over a decade. (St. Martin finally escaped.)  He took exact measurements of hundreds of foods digested ...\n\n1) chewed an swallowed   2) entered directly through the hole   3) digested in a beaker outside the stomach\n\nCan Atom explain why some people have their feet swell to large, painful proportions when they travel by airplane, and what some lasting solutions are for this issue?\nI was wondering if you knew if someone that had PRK or LASIK eye surgery years ago, would get the same results with the Bates method today if the eyes have regressed over the years.\n\n\nSo if carbon dioxide is life force energy and it's released through the anus as flatulence... The question is, how many farts must I recycle before becoming immortal?\n\nDo either of you have any inputs or experiences about left and right nostril breathing?\n\nI had been having terrible gut pain on my left side waking me up at night. The color was a transparent royal blue as if painted on white paper. There were spring green tinges at the edges of the blob of blue.\n\nAtom had diagnosed this as a trauma relating to mom.\n\nThe colors show Im still missing my mother, esp. the part of me that followed her advice (or the exact opposite —> the advice I didn't get from her and had to seek elsewhere from idealized mother figures).\n\nHi Patrick and Atom: My 65 year old male friend has had 3 small strokes in the past 2 months. The doctors have confirmed the strokes by a brain scan, but have no idea what is causing them. Prior to the strokes he described himself as active and healthy. Would you have any idea where he should start looking for a cause? \n\nHaving spikes in blood pressure that seem to be correlated to my upper cervical and general spine miss-alignments. How does that work and any remedies to control in between chiro visits\n\nHow to best prepare before her mid-week hip replacement, primarily to avoid high blood pressure from pre-operative stress and prevent any ill effects on brain from being put under?\n\n. As she also has kyphosis, is there anything simple she could do in rehab to alleviate her bend posture? And to control her neuropathy in her legs due to tightness in the stockings she wears for varicose veins?\n\n One thing is to avoid canola oil. Most restaurants processed foods have it.\n Guys! Seeing Atom live is a treat. Thank you both.\n\nCan Atom explain why the body would deteriorate both hips. Not with arthritis, but avascular necrosis where the bones were dying.\n\nWhat does Atom think of eating honey... how much should we use?\n\nWhat about hypoglycemia? When I was younger, I used to drink a lot of juice and eat a lot of cereal in the morning. I used to get lightheaded, weak and shaking an hour or two after breakfast. Now I mainly eat eggs for breakfast and more protein and less carbs and I rarely get that hypoglycemic feeling.\n\nIf prana is carbon dioxide retention, then should we start drinking\ncarbonated beverages to increase prana?\n\n\nDoes blackstrap molasses have any benefit?  \n\nWhat is the best time to breath hydrogen gas and drink hydrogen water?\n\nMy daughter was very tired and almost passed out. I had molasses and tomato juice. It fixed her up immediately 15 minutes.\nIt was magic!! Thank you Atom!!!\n\nAtom Bergstrom, Yes No Maybe and big yes for this nearly three hour show, November 18, 2019 ONE",

It's a bit unnerving. So I've been cooking them in water on low heat for a few hours. How do you cook 'em?.....and then what\n\nSpeaking of freezing fruits and whatever, One World Whey is \"Cold Processed\" and therefore suppose to be better than heating and is advertised as not destroying the beneficial enzymes.\n\nPatrick i talked to woman at living streams and she said Wayne passed away I WAS BLOWN AWAY ...sorry if you talked about it on an earlier show .",

The second thei mentioned carbon credits, I knew it was a scam.\n\nFrom Atom on Thyroid  Pandiculating and sticking out the tongue detox the thyroid gland.  Rocking the thyroid between the thumb and index finger also help.\n\nA lady asked Dr. Daniels about healing bunions and I recently noticed I was developing one on my right foot because I walk with a gate due to MS that makes me use my right leg more than my left, anyhow, I purchased a pair of yoga sandals which spreads your toes apart and it has helped a lot already. I almost never walk with bare feet because my feet are too sensitive so I just wear the yoga sandals around as much as my life allows. Just an idea. I have been on LDN for going on 3 weeks now and I'm seeing some improvements in my gate with that too.\n\nAccording to Pete Egoscue, bunions are caused by a postural imbalance.\nWhen the body is off balance, it builds a base to compensate for the \nimbalance and we call that a bunion, but it is due to an imbalance.\nHas anyone using the hydrogen machine noticed improvement with their balance?",

            "description": "Perhaps folks with the \"brain\" disorders who appear not to be in pain, are so much in the now that of course there's no memory of much of anything, cause it's always now.\n\nWe talk about Dr. Ray Peat's opinion that very small does of piggie thyroid just may be the way to go for many reasons including not having to be on these supplements forever\n\nListen inquires about keeping Mr. Prostate happy\n\nMatt calls in and chats about is project to create a ice bath unit that will offer 38 degree tub of water on demand.  Brrr\n\nVal calls in from Kentucky and we have a nice chat out some of the things she's working with, including speaking out more for gallbladder heath, using MMS for Candida\n\nLots of interest and emails on the parasite protocol offered by past guest, Barbara Frank\n\nGot milk?  Patrick's experimenting with using raw milk, prepared properly to build muscle\n\nCaller asks about getting rid of knot that formed with repairing a Achilles tendon\n\nWe mention the IT man who moved to Asia to put out natural piggie thyroid, yet currently are not shipping because some one(s) are hijacking the shipments.  Here's the link nonetheless\n\n\nI totally agree with you on the global warming/ climate change. The second thei mentioned carbon credits, I knew it was a scam.\n\nFrom Atom on Thyroid  Pandiculating and sticking out the tongue detox the thyroid gland.  Rocking the thyroid between the thumb and index finger also help.\n\nA lady asked Dr. Daniels about healing bunions and I recently noticed I was developing one on my right foot because I walk with a gate due to MS that makes me use my right leg more than my left, anyhow, I purchased a pair of yoga sandals which spreads your toes apart and it has helped a lot already. I almost never walk with bare feet because my feet are too sensitive so I just wear the yoga sandals around as much as my life allows. Just an idea. I have been on LDN for going on 3 weeks now and I'm seeing some improvements in my gate with that too.\n\nAccording to Pete Egoscue, bunions are caused by a postural imbalance.\nWhen the body is off balance, it builds a base to compensate for the \nimbalance and we call that a bunion, but it is due to an imbalance.\nHas anyone using the hydrogen machine noticed improvement with their balance?",

            "description": "Wait...we're being told Carbon Dioxide is killing us and Atom suggests that Prana, or what is known as \"life\" in Eastern cultures is made of Carbon Dioxide.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:  Prana\n\nIn Hindu philosophy including yoga, Indian medicine and Indian martial arts, prana (प्राण, prāṇa; the Sanskrit word for breath, \"life force\", or \"vital principle\")[1] permeates reality on all levels including inanimate objects.[2] In Hindu literature, prana is sometimes described as originating from the Sun and connecting the elements.[3]\n\nHow Oranges saved Atom's life...sort of..but it sounded good.\n\nlifting weights, moving, resistance training, isometrics should be incorporated into our everyday life and not made a \"thing\" to do and it spoils the benefits\n\nThe old adage \"if you don't loose it, you loose it...\" is true.  See Sarcopenia\n\nWhat are some good proteins to have in the morning\n\nAtom had pizza and hamburger with relatives, first time in many years...and is still with us today\n\nListen and learn about the gallbladder, it's role in acid reflux and tummy troubles\n\nHear the story on how he believes his stomach issues journey started over five years ago.\n\nAtom manifested a magazine store and gym one fine day years ago.  Boom.\n\nAvocado is a great morning food.  Something for everyone\n\nSprouts are a good source of protein\n\nRed lights build muscle and overall health and do not have to be right on top of us\n\nHave a little goat cheese and Essene bread around Noon for strength\n\nBest time for resistance training is 3-5 PM\n\nSome emails:\n\nI've heard a number of people warn about mold and bacteria that accrues in the tanks of water systems such as reverse osmosis systems.\n\nTheoretically, if I wanted to sterilize the water of mold, what could be done? I was thinking about adding some oil of oregano or lemon juice while it boils or a small bit of baking soda after it's cooked. Any ideas?\nare apples a good way to remove endotoxins? And how come someone with Rheumatoid arthritis is alkaline, when the entire world says you are acidic with this disease. and how can I get balanced then?\n\nCan Atom give some ideas how to cure a terrible cough. I tried pouring some sugar in my coffee, but can't figure out how much is needed for this to work\n\nWhat would you do if you had a heart attack\n\nDoes Atom think that cavities at the level of the dentin are reversible? Cavity reversal of cavities on the enamel is reported often, but I can't find anything about cavities in the dentin.\n\n2) What does Atom think of dental implants that are done by a biological dentist? I understand that they block meridians which run through the teeth which would be a reason to avoid them, but if someone has an uneven palate, (for instance I'm missing 4 wisdom teeth and 1 molar) would an implant eventually be necessary to preserve the face?\n\n3) Why does Atom recommend pairing members of the apricot family with almonds in the morning?\n\n4) Also... Why does Atom think it is that regular marijuana use seems to stifle the memory of some but not others?\n\n\nMorning !!! I had an Energy Scan and found out I may have ..coronary artery calcification ... found that asparagus is really good to remove plaque...!!??? Any thoughts ???\n\nWith the many years that Atom has extensively researched his new e-book “Mesmerism and Miracles”, can he share several examples of some miraculous, “Act of God” physical transformations that people were able to achieve using Mesmerism?\n\nWhat is the cause of nightly tooth grinding and what can be done to help it? I have a friend who says he has been doing this since he was 14 years old and now he is 35!  The dentist says he will lose his teeth if it keeps happening.  Thanks so much for all you so.",

            "description": "In our continuing effort to hook Dr. Daniels up with just the right man, she tell of her dating model\n\nGet her understanding on Vitamin D, the levels, cholesterol levels and the rest of the story\n\nThe three best foods says the good doctor for cholesterol are eggs; liver and brains\n\nWhere does the COQ 10 come regarding statins\n\nLadies, when you give birth at the hospital they own and sell your placenta.  Go figure.\n\nMilk Thistle is a tried and true way to keep Mr. and Mrs. Liver happy\n\nCastor oil on the face to ditch brown spots\n\nLots of emails...here's a few of them:\n\nWhat can be used to heal people\nwhose ankles/tendons were injured  by quinolone drugs?   Thanks Patrick or having her on the show.\n\n. What do you recommend for a natural lip moisturizer. I have tried a coconut oil and beezwax mixture that was too irritating for regular use. Most oils like olive oil rub off quickly so looking for something with a thicker texture.\n\nQuestion for Dr. Jennifer Daniels is it safe to rub turpentine on belly or body part to help with pain and detox or is it not suggested? If so, how often? I also add a few drops in bathtub as in 2 or 4 drops as it is strong and it may take 5 or 10 minutes to feel it as you soak\n\nHi Patrick and Dr Daniels,  60 year old male in good health, no drugs at all with osteoarthritic hip. Pain when I walk and sometimes throbs before a rainy day.  What is Dr Daniels’ absolute best and trusted remedy to repair this issue? Please provide amounts and frequency of your all-natural suggestions......Luv you both and thank you for simply caring enough to make a difference.\n\nHow does one get rid of ugly red spider veins on the legs?\n2. One eye is problematic, sometimes painful, always blurry. The eye dr says the reason is the vitreous gel has turned to fluid & that is normal aging. Any thoughts on this please?\n\nI recently tested positive for Herpes Type 2 genital. Is the medical blood test for herpes Type 2 accurate and reliable ? \n\nMy 42 year old wife went to her doctor for a general checkup and she tested positive for urea plasma in her vagina by swab & urine test which showed chronic inflammation in her womb. She was told that this can cause cervical cancer and prevent future pregnancy.\n\nShe was given anti-biotics and tested negative one month later.\n\nI on the other hand am her 51 year old husband and also tested positive for urea plasma by urine test but did not take any anti-biotics. I re-tested positive one month later, although I have no symptoms.  Q. Is it a problem to have urea plasma like they are saying\n\nGreetings Dr. Daniels\nRemedy for severe brown spots on face, some are bigger (quarter size), some are thicker (small in size). Do I need to resort to taking Retinol Cream or a natural remedy would fix the problem? BTW, I am taking Milk Thistle to clean my liver.\n\n1 When I started taking turpentine (diamond G brand) and sugar, for a few days after I got cystitus/kidney type symptoms (needing to urinate very frequently but only a small bit coming out) but without the pain.. I looked this up online and found a reddit post where a girl had had same symptoms after taking turpentine.. Do you know what this might be?  2 I have read that putting turpentine in your belly button is very effective at getting it quickly around your body.. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nDo you take cod liver oil, and if so, what do you think are the health benefits?",
