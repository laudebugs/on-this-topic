            "description": "In this episode, Baxter sits down for a fascinating interview with Dr. Adam Dipert who is successfully spearheading an effort to explore dance in zero gravity. In this episode, Adam explains the many mind-blowing concepts and ideas of moving artistically in actual outer space and the surprising impacts in can (and will) have on the way we conceive of ourselves.\r\n\r\nDr. Adam Dipert is a Particle and Astrophysicist, who is also a Co-Founder of Giant Leap, the first zero gravity dance company ever. He is also a flow and circus performer whose performances have been viewed over 1,000,000 times. \r\n\r\nResources to find out more:\r\n\r\nwww.giantleapdance.com\r\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/gaintleap.dance/\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/GiantLeapDance/\r\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/GiantLeapDance\r\n\r\nThumbnail: Adam Dipert and Kitsou DuBois (inset)\r\n\r\nKitsou DuBois: https://www.kitsoudubois.com\r\n\r\nIf you dig the FutureHero podcast, please share, like, subscribe and rate it for us!<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FutureheroPodcast/~4/mcODQ2_LHxA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

You can find in on Facebook or on Youtube.\r\n\r\nYoutube: https://youtu.be/xZlPFfTaVfw\r\n\r\nI'm back! Ann Humphreys sits down with me in studio and flips the script by asking ME the questions. Over the podcast we discuss my life with music, how I got into dance, the HoopPath, blindfolded movement, how we met, and few other surprise topics. The conversation is mix of humor, history, and philosophy.  Because this is a conversation, we do not have background music. \r\nFear not, however, this podcast is not about me, but I received so many messages asking where I have been and what I have been up to, that I decided to start back the podcast with something more personal.\r\n\r\nYou can hear this podcast on all podcast platforms, including Spotify. \r\n\r\nThank you for listening!

            "description": "Baxter delivered this talk at HP: Calgary.  Baxter is speaking to a group of 40+ hoop dancers, sitting in a circle.  Unfortunately, some of the comments from the group are hard to hear.  This will be corrected in the future.  Baxter begins every class and workshop with an opening improvised talk.  In this talk, he discusses how one can find and gain confidence through the use of their imaginations.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FutureheroPodcast/~4/QSokK-tCf1M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

The world can be such an angry place, and it is easy to become swept up in hostility for those with whom we do not agree.  Yet, agreement with all peoples, is not prerequisite to Love for all peoples.  Listening can cultivate understanding, and understanding can bridge great divides between hearts without detriment to either party.  To be in peace, is to be more open to life and its many lessons. \r\n\r\nMusic by The Human Experience \r\nSoundcloud:  https://soundcloud.com/thehumanexperience\r\nBandcamp:  https://thehumanexperience.bandcamp.com\r\nSongs used:  \r\n\"Butterfly, The metamorphosis\"\r\n\"Dusty Rose\"\r\n\"Beads of the Wind\" \r\n\r\nSpoken word:  Baxter\r\nwww.futureheropodcast.com\r\niTunes:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/futurehero-podcast/id1082878677?mt=2\r\n\r\nArtwork:  Steinunn Þórarinsdóttir\r\n\r\nDonate:  PayPal.Me/baxterpodcast<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FutureheroPodcast/~4/GzK0sDOjfuk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
