I've been using this camera for about a week now - so how does it stack up to the GoPro Hero7 Black? Both do 4k video and 12 megapixel stills.

In this video we’ll take a look at an external GPU or eGPU setup.\n\n\t\t\t\tI'm using a Dell XPS 15 9570 laptop, but you can use any laptop that supports Thunderbolt 3 and has a minimum of 16GB of RAM and an i5 processor (i7 8th generation recommended) - this could be somethign like the Razer Blade 15, Razer Blade Stealth or HP Spectre 13. You can also run an eGPU with a Macbook but using NVIDIA cards is going to require a lot of workarounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tThis is an excellent way to speed up the performance of applications such as Lightroom, Premiere Pro and After Effects by adding an external GPU card.\n\n\t\t\t\tAlso worth noting - as I am posting this video, NVIDIA has just announced as I’m releasing this video, NVIDIA has announced their new RTX Studio laptops.

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Sony 135mm f/1.8 G Master lens is the 31st lens in Sony's full-frame, e-mount lineup.\n\n\t\t\t\tI quickly fell in love with this lens - it is outstanding. Designed for longer portraits, this has some of the best optical rendering that I've seen on any lens to date. This is the ultimate portrait lens. Bokeh is excellent, it has outstanding sharpness and the autofocus speeds are impressive. This has the same XD linear drive system that is found in the Sony 400mm f/2.8 G Master as well as the Sony 24mm f/1.4 G Master lenses.\n\n\t\t\t\tOne correction - around 03:17 I say there's little spherical aberration at small apertures when in face I meant to say diffraction. This is where the sharpness softens in the lens and for most lenses this starts around f/16. Its been a long week - sorry for the confusion.\n\n\t\t\t\tCheck out my other videos:\n\t\t\t\t• Sony 400mm f/2.8 G Master Lens Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pix0A5TGn8\n\t\t\t\t• Sony 24mm f/1.4 G Master Lens Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW-xRCrZXIc\n\t\t\t\t• Why Sony Is Absolutely Killing It Right Now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hYMgDT_iAI\n\t\t\t\t• Sony RX100 V :: Wow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuY48hNitCA\n\t\t\t\t• Sony a5100 :: The Best Deal In Photography? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuY48hNitCA\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

Experiencing the works of art by Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, John Chamberlain, Robert Irwin and many others - it requires attention.

The idea of working on mobile is attractive to me because I spend a good amount of the year traveling.

Its a really unique filter system designed for high-end architectural and landscape photography applications. I'm good friends with the owner, Rod Clark and he just sent me the new 150 Filter Holder. The 150 is designed for wide-angle lenses that don't have filter threading. The attachment for the filter holder goes over the lens and tightens into place. The attachment is made of glass-filled nylon so its extremely tough but also as light as a feather. These are made on an industrial 3D printer so they can produce these for very unconventional lenses and have them in production in as little as 3 weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tIf you're interested in Wine Country - check out the website and use offer code AOP to save 15% off of anything and everything in their store.\n\n\t\t\t\thttp://www.winecountry.camera\n\n\t\t\t\tThanks to all who sent me books this week - check them out here!\n\n\t\t\t\tOliver Krebs :: Signal to Noise https://www.kehrerverlag.com/en/oliver-krebs-signal-noise\n\t\t\t\tHenry Balaszeskul :: Einhunderstelf https://www.einhundertelf.info\n\t\t\t\tMarie Boyard :: Yunomi https://www.yunomimag.com\n\n\t\t\t\tCheck out my other videos:\n\t\t\t\t• Creative Photography VS Technical Photography https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zy6RF6w3BI\n\t\t\t\t• The ONE THING to take your LANDSCAPE Photography to the next level https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FUnWbmTDKU\n\t\t\t\t• $63,000 Camera https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq2LmstGD5M\n\t\t\t\t• Why Every Photography Needs an ND Filter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VExYd-BeMrM\n\t\t\t\t• Hot Air Balloon with a Sony Infrared Camera https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krcKbSUHmSE\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

This allows for subjects that might turn or pass behind an object as the camera stays in focus on that subject.\n\n\t\t\t\tIt works and its not bad - especially considering the price point. The one area that's problematic is in the graphic display that tells you what its focusing it on.

This is an interesting release from Sony as it seems they have upgraded the a6300 and a6500 cameras specifically targeted at vlogging, but the autofocus system additions push this camera over the top for me. While they're not nearly as fast as the Sony a9, they do offer a new range of flexibility if you wish to track your subject in real time. The artificial intelligence algorithms intelligently track subjects with the ability to recognize color patterns in addition to face detection and eye detection.

This involved removing the infrared and low-pass filters from the sensor to allow light beyond the visual spectrum to be recorded in the image. You can limit this light by using filters on the lens. For these images, I used a 720nm Infrared filter so you're only seeing infrared light. I converted the images to black and white and the results were really surprising!\n\n\t\t\t\tBack when I shot black and white film, I did so because I loved the results you could get by manipulating the exposure and chemical development to get different results. As digital photography became more mainstream, I never got the same enjoyment from digital post production. Digital Cameras are optimized for color output and its just not the same. Using a full spectrum conversion though is the closest we've come to the old film days because you can actually control your end-result in the camera.\n\n\t\t\t\t#SonyAlpha\n\n\t\t\t\tCheck out my other videos:\n\t\t\t\t• Sony Sensor Hack :: Seeing Light Differently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CUUhJ_i_A\n\t\t\t\t• Sony FE 24mm f/1.4 G Master Lens https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW-xRCrZXIc\n\t\t\t\t• Why Sony Is Killing It Right Now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hYMgDT_iAI\n\t\t\t\t• How Good Are Sony Lenses? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLJQG_pU3J4\n\t\t\t\t• Sony RX100 V :: WOW! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuY48hNitCA\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Fujifilm X-T3 is a powerhouse mirrorless camera featuring up to 30 frames per second burst rate shooting and internal 10-bit video at 4:2:0.\n\n\t\t\t\tGet your's at B&H https://goo.gl/RdUHZm\n\t\t\t\tAmazon https://amzn.to/2Smstjz\n\n\t\t\t\tFujifilm released the X-T3 this year as the successor to the popular X-T2. This is a massive upgrade for both stills and video. The X-T2 was a fantastic camera, but had some limitations in terms of power management. You really did need to purchase the battery grip to enable faster burst rate shooting as well as video recording time and overall performance. The grip allowed the camera to use 3 batteries at once.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Fujifilm X-T3 represents an optimized rethinking of the X-T2. In addition to the brand new, back-side illuminated X-Trans 4 sensor and X Processor, the firmware in the camera has been redesigned as well and you actually get more features than the X-T2 and you can access everything to its fullest potential without having to use the optional battery grip.\n\n\t\t\t\tFor shooting stills, the camera now features burst-rate speeds up to 30 fps (with electronic shutter). Autofocus also got a major upgrade with phase detection AF points added across the entire frame.\n\n\t\t\t\tVideo is now 10-bit and will record at 4:2:0 internal or 4:2:2 external via the HDMI port. The camera will shoot in f-log as well adding a tremendous amount of flexibility in post production color grading. Future firmware updates will include a HLG (hybrid log gamma) profile as well.\n\n\t\t\t\tAnd the best part - the Fujifilm X-T3 is actually cheaper than the X-T2 was when it was released. This is an affordable powerhouse of a camera and the best to date in the Fujifilm ecosystem.\n\n\t\t\t\tFujifilm X-T3 features:\n\t\t\t\t• 26 megapixel APS-C X-Trans BSI CMOS 4 Sensor\n\t\t\t\t• X-Processor 4 with Quad CPU\n\t\t\t\t• 1080p and 4k UHD video up to 60p\n\t\t\t\t• F-log gamma and 10-bit Output\n\t\t\t\t• 2.16 million phase-detection autofocus points\n\t\t\t\t• 0.75x 3.69 million dot OLED viewfinder\n\t\t\t\t• 3 inch, 1.04 million dot, tilting LCD touchscreen\n\t\t\t\t• Extended ISO 80-51200\n\t\t\t\t• Burst rate shooting speeds up to 30 frams per second\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCheck out my other videos:\n\t\t\t\t• Fujifilm X-T100 :: The New Best Deal In Photography https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9u5JVSKdo\n\t\t\t\t• The Fujifilm X-E3 is INCREDIBLE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjCjp-6lhcA\n\t\t\t\t• Fujifilm nailed this… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlje4uLW7og\n\t\t\t\t• Fujifilm X-T2 :: Brilliant Design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlje4uLW7og\n\t\t\t\t• My Favorite Fujifilm Lenses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3K9IBcHYK4\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

They gave me some wonderful tips on how to shoot aviation in broad sunlight. \n\n\t\t\t\tThe Sony A9 is simply outstanding. With its stacked CMOS sensor it is capable of shooting raw files at 20 frames a second with no blackout in the viewfinder. More importantly it can adjust the autofocus up to 60 times a second. It is one of the fastest and most powerful mirrorless cameras I have used to date.\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

Both of these are medium format.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe GFX 50R is a compact, \"rangefinder\" style version of their previous camera - the Fujifilm GFX 50S. It brings over the same sensor in a much smaller and more portable configuration. The price point is considerably lower as well. Also added is Bluetooth integration.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Fujifilm GFX 100S concept is a camera to be released in 2019. This is where things get particularly interesting. The 100S will feature a 102 megapixel sensor, IBIS (in-body image stabilization) as well as 4k video and phase detection autofocus across the entire sensor. I'm guessing this will be an entirely new sensor likely not built by Sony.\n\n\t\t\t\tBut my favorite announcement today is the Fujifilm partnership with Phase One in the Capture One software. Capture One has not supported any medium format cameras other than Phase One until now. This is a huge step forward. I love Capture One and use it all the time. But this has been a stumbling block for Capture One - they have to support all cameras if they intend to gain traction in the raw image editor application space.\n\n\t\t\t\tOver view of Fujifilm announcements:\n\t\t\t\t• Fujifilm GFX 50R - smaller rangefinder style body, 50 megapixel sensor\n\t\t\t\t• Fujifilm GFX 100S - Concept camera to be released in 2019\n\t\t\t\t• Capture One support for Fujifilm Medium Format Cameras and film profiles\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

This individual is somewhat frustrated and its completely understandable. I personally believe that everyone in the world has the power to do anything they want. There are countless people who are proof of this. But the bottom line is that most can't/don't/won't which is why my advice should fire you up even more.\n\n\t\t\t\t• Define what you are trying to succeed at specifically. Chase that goal, but don't close yourself off to other opportunities.\n\t\t\t\t• Be careful about \"creating work for yourself\"\n\t\t\t\t• Do the work.

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSony is making some of the best full frame mirrorless cameras in the world. How do their lenses stack up to the other options?\n\n\t\t\t\tThe last 2 mirrorless lenses that Sony has produced have shown us the direction things will be going in the next few years. Not only are the designs extremely innovative but also the materials used in these lenses. Sony have a method of producing XA elements, or Extreme Aspherical elements in a way where they can both dial in the clarity of bokeh in an image and also reduce sagittal flaring issues in astro photography. XA elements are made by molding glass, not grinding. So there is a much greater control to smoothness to tolerances of 0.01 microns.\n\n\t\t\t\tBokeh is also controlled with the use of 11 aperture blades over the traditional 9 (Canon uses 8). This allows you to maintain a circular aperture when stopping down slightly to get a better optical performance out of the lens.\n\n\t\t\t\tAnd finally Sony has created essentially a solid state camera with the development of direct drive super sonic wave motors that are used in the autofocus system. This allows for faster, more accurate and quiet autofocus.\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound. If you need music for your videos, Epidemic is simply the best in the business.

Canon has been pretty quiet over the last few years and Sony has made it quite obvious that the competition has fallen behind. Canon also announced 4 lenses - a 24-105mm, 28-70mm, 35mm and a 50mm. Is the Canon system enough to compete with the Nikon Z6 and Z7? Does it compete with Sony? Lets break it down.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Canon EOS R\n\t\t\t\t• 30MP full frame sensor\n\t\t\t\t• Dual Pixel Raw, micro-adjustment, bokeh shift and ghosting reduction\n\t\t\t\t• 5,655 selectable AF points\n\t\t\t\t• 8fps burst rate with one-shot AF\n\t\t\t\t• 5fps burst rate with servo AF/AE\n\t\t\t\t• 1 SD card slot – UHS-II compatible\n\t\t\t\t• UGD 4k up to 25/30p – 1.6x crop\n\t\t\t\t• Canon log profile\n\t\t\t\t• 4k uncompressed 10 bit HDMI output\n\t\t\t\t• HDR movie, 4k Time-lapse movie\n\t\t\t\t• Focus Peaking / Focus Distance Indicator\n\t\t\t\t• 3.1″ vari-angle, 2.1 million dot LCD with touch control\n\t\t\t\t• GPS via phone app\n\t\t\t\t• Wi-fi/Bluetooth\n\t\t\t\t• LP-E6 / LP-E6N Battery\n\n\t\t\t\tAnd unfortunately way too many \"gotchas\" on these features.\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic is from Epidemic Sound.

Panasonic and Olypmus have had mirrorless cameras with their micro 4/3 system.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe next month is going to be very interesting in terms of camera announcements from Nikon, followed immediately by Canon and then rumors say Sony will follow with another as well.\n\n\t\t\t\tBut the interesting newcomer is Nikon. Nikon failed with their last mirrorless attempt - the Nikon 1. So far we know there are likely 2 camera bodies they will announce as well as 3 lenses and an adapter for the older F mount lenses. Will this be enough to compete with Sony and Fuji who already have fully developed systems?\n\n\t\t\t\tThese are my thoughts as to what Nikon need to succeed:\n\n\t\t\t\t• Develop a sensor that gives us dynamic range like we're seeing with Medium Format Cameras\n\t\t\t\t• Develop an autofocus system that competes with Sony's Eye AF\n\t\t\t\t• Develop some actually interesting lenses, not just generic f/2.8 zooms\n\t\t\t\t• Provide some legitimate video options - 4k, high frame rate, log profiles and 10-bit.\n\t\t\t\t• Find a niche and figure out what will make people want to use Nikon\n\n\t\t\t\tThis video is sponsored by Squarespace.

Sony has officially stepped into the professional sports photography arena with its new zoom lens. Weighing over 2 lbs lighter than the Nikon 400mm f/2.8 E FL ED VR is 11.47 and the Canon EF 400mm f/2.8L USM, the Sony 400mm GM also features a more balanced design, sharper image rendition and faster autofocus supporting the Sony A9's 20 frames per second shooting speed.\n\n\t\t\t\tThis lens is extremely significant, not only being better than the competition optically and mechanically, but it also represents what Sony has been striving for with mirrorless cameras providing the best in class system for sports and wildlife photography.\n\n\t\t\t\tSony contacted me a few weeks ago and asked if I'd like to come to New Jersey to photograph soccer. I jumped at the opportunity to photograph the New York Red Bulls play FC Dallas. So the USA did not make it far in the World Cup, but this shows us what the possibilities that the future holds - not only for the World Cup but also for photography.\n\n\t\t\t\tWhile Sony did bring me to New Jersey to test this lens, this video is not sponsored and the opinions here are my own.\n\n\t\t\t\tFeatured in this video:\n\t\t\t\tJared Polin https://www.youtube.com/user/JaredPolin/\n\t\t\t\tSteve Huff https://www.youtube.com/user/stevehuff1969\n\t\t\t\tChelsea Northrup https://www.youtube.com/user/VistaClues\n\t\t\t\tGordon Laing https://www.youtube.com/user/cameralabs\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Hasselblad 21mm f/4 is the widest lens Hasselblad has produced to date. The closest focal range this would come close to would be the Fujifilm 23mm GFX. \n\n\t\t\t\tThis lens has a full frame equivalent to about 17mm - it is wide. Its also extremely impressive in terms of performance. This is a difficult lens to design within the limitations of portability, price, and fitting in with the rest of the system. The engineers at Hasselblad have done a brilliant job with this lens. \n\n\t\t\t\tIts very much a technical lens with incredible distortion control and edge to edge sharpness. The 21mm f/4 is perfect for architectural photography - particularly interiors and tight spaces that can be challenging to photograph.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe lens features 13 elements in 9 groups, 2 aspherical elements, an aperture range of f/4 to f/32, central lens shutter with up to 1/2000 sec flash sync, internal focusing with manual focus override and a front filter threading of 77mm.\n\n\t\t\t\tHasselblad were kind enough to loan me one from the first production  run for a week to test. \n\n\t\t\t\tYou can get one at B&H: https://goo.gl/pecEtJ\n\n\t\t\t\tAOP T-SHIRTS! https://aop.threadless.com/\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn researching further about Steve McCurry's Afghan Girl, I found an interesting alternate take of the image as well as the story behind the photograph.\n\n\t\t\t\tWhen we're talking about the photographer's intention, this becomes a very broad discussion. We're talking about composition, color theory and the technical things that produce the finished photograph, but there's a broader space. These are all things we have to learn in photography but when it comes to getting the shot, we have to forget all about the rule of thirds, the rule of odds and all the other technical compositional tools and we go for realizing the intent.\n\n\t\t\t\tSteve McCurry had a very clear intent when he first saw the Afghan Girl. This was expressed consciously and subconsciously throughout the entire process and ended up being one of the most famous National Geographic covers in the history of the magazine.\n\n\t\t\t\tHIGHLY recommended book of Steve McCurry Portraits: https://amzn.to/2y9f8FJ\n\n\t\t\t\tCheck out the interview with Steve here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIgx-nkFL6c\n\n\t\t\t\tAOP T-Shirts! https://aop.threadless.com/\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

In this video I want to talk about what happens in front of your lens and how you can get really effective results by limiting your color palette. Steve McCurry's Afghan girl is an incredible example of this. Its not only a famous photograph but it has become iconic over the years. Everything in this composition supports the eyes including color.\n\n\t\t\t\tMcCurry took this image on with a Nikon FM2, 105mm f/2.5 lens and used Kodachrome 64. While many contest that this is a definitive Kodachrome image, I actually argue that its the selection of colors that was important and keeping them reduced to essentially 3 - red, green and the skin-tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tAOP T-shirts! https://aop.threadless.com/\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIntention is the point of all photography. How do you intend for your work to look? The intention of the photographer starts with the idea, concept and composition of the image and its carried all the way through to the final printed work. Photography today has changed in some ways because we tend to publish our work for screen-based devices, but the intention of the photographer - or your intent shouldn't be sacrificed.\n\n\t\t\t\tWilliam Eggleston, Ernst Haas, Luigi Ghirri and Saul Leiter were all color photographers with different styles and different looks to their work. They represent the best photographers of their time. Yet they all shot on Kodachrome. So why does their work look vastly different from one another yet they were using the same film stock? The answer is in the intent. Each had a unique intention to how their work would look, what it would say and how it would communicate to the viewer. The answer is in the printing stage of photography. This is where decisions were made that created unique works.\n\n\t\t\t\tPrinting workshop with Richard Jackson, Marielle Wilkes and Wesley Bernard\n\t\t\t\thttps://goo.gl/LTf6AS\n\n\t\t\t\tAOP T-Shirts! https://aop.threadless.com/\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

In this video, Doug Peterson shows us his method of focus stacking on the Phase One XF with the IQ3 Trichromatic back.\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can do this with any camera. The challenge of macro photography is working with an extremely shallow depth of field. Phase One will do automatic calculations for the photos you want to stack but this can be done manually with any camera.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe software we used for stitching the final image is called Zerene Stacker. It does have a 30 day trial if you want to try it out.\n\n\t\t\t\thttps://zerenesystems.com/cms/stacker\n\n\t\t\t\tArt of Photography shirts: https://aop.threadless.com\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

This is a quote I read a few months ago that's stuck with me for quite some time. Ansel Adams didn't have gear as advanced as what we have now. Neither did Henri Cartier-Bresson or W Eugene Smith or Saul Leiter. Photographers tend to put equipment on a pedestal. We blame our shortcomings as photographers on the gear that we have. Sony, Nikon and Canon all market to us in that way - you need the latest and the greatest because your photography depends on it!\n\n\t\t\t\tThe truth is that important work… work that matters - doesn't have anything to do with the technology we have access to. It has everything to do with what we have to say and communicate visually.

Matt Beaty took me off roading through Arizona to get some epic landscape photos and test out the Phase One.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Phase One IQ3 is a 101 megapixel, medium format back. It uses a custom bayer filter design that separates Red, Green and Blue light in a new way that other digital cameras do no. In the RGB spectrum, there is always some degree of overlay. The Phase One design separates these a bit more than conventional cameras. The cost is about 1/3 an f-stop of light but the results are stunning.\n\n\t\t\t\tMatt Beaty\n\t\t\t\thttps://www.instagram.com/mattbeaty/\n\n\t\t\t\tDigital Transitions\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://digitaltransitions.com/\">https://digitaltransitions.com/</a>\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

I was told this back is the first one in the US so I was pretty excited.\n\n\t\t\t\tThis camera setup is a game changer. The Phase One IQ3 Monochrome back is one of the most exciting things to happen in camera design in the age of digital photography. The sensor weighs in at a cool 101 Megapixels and its designed to capture light past the visual spectrum. When you understand how to shape this using filters you have one of the most advanced, digital monochrome cameras ever made. The results are stunning.\n\n\t\t\t\tSpecial Thanks to Digital Transitions for loaning me the camera and to Rod Clark who makes the best filter system on the market for setting it all up!

They seemed to have cleaned up a lot of the little frustrations with the A7rII, increased the performance and added some nice new features for both still and video shooting in 4k. The camera will be available at the end of November.\n\n\t\t\t\tSony also introduced 2 lenses - the 24-105 f/4.0 OSS FE and a telephoto prime - a 400mm f/2.8 to be released in the summer of 2018.\n\n\t\t\t\tAlso announced as I was about to film this video - DxO has purchased Nik Software from Google. This is incredible news as Nik is one of the best post production packages I've used. Google have announced they're abandoning development on Nik so its nice to see someone committed to keeping it up to date. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Essentially subframing is using elements in your composition to frame up the subject – its like a picture in a picture. There are many ways to use this technique, you can be subtle or more obvious, but its an excellent way to create more depth in your photography composition.\n\n\t\t\t\tCheck out Craig Whitehead (sixstreetunder)\n\t\t\t\thttps://www.sixstreetunder.com\n\t\t\t\thttps://www.instagram.com/sixstreetunder\n\t\t\t\thttps://twitter.com/sixstreetunder\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

As a protégé of the modernest master Manuel Alvarez Bravo, she worked as his assistant before starting her own career in photography in the early 1970’s. Working mostly in large-scale documentary projects, she was commissioned in 1978 by the Ethnographic Archive of the National Indigenous Institute of Mexico to photograph Mexico’s indigenous population. The resulting project photographing the Seri Indians yielded one of her most iconic works, Mujer ángel, Desierto de Sonora in 1979. She has worked in her native Mexcio as well as Cuba, East Germany, India, Madagascar, Hungary, Paris and the United States. She was the recipient of the W Eugene Smith grant in 1971 and the prestigious Hasselblad award in 2008.\n\n\t\t\t\tMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/v5wWKr\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Artist Series is made possible by the people who support the show.

Beautiful and engaging, it is very different than the Lartigue we’re familiar with.\n\n\t\t\t\tBook: Lartigue, Life In Color – http://amzn.to/2d4yFej\n\n\t\t\t\tLartigue’s color photography was done during 2 different periods. The first was his use of Autochrome plates from 1911-1926. Autochrome had a specific look used by photographers such as Heinrich Kuen.\n\n\t\t\t\tLartigue went back to color a second time in the mid 1950’s with film as by this time he was shooting 35mm with his Leica’s and 120 format with his Rolleiflex. The work from this period is absolutely wonderful and rivals many of his contemporaries doing color work at the mid-century such as Saul Leiter.\n\n\t\t\t",

            "description": " \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJacques Henri Lartigue was largely unknown as a photographer until the age of 70. Born in Courbevoie to a wealthy family, he took up photography about the age of 7. Some of his most famous photographs were made as a teenager. His subjects ranged from auto-racing to aviation. Lartigue's use of action in his photographs set him apart from many photographers of the time.\n\n\t\t\t\tAfter the family money started running out in the 1930's, Lartigue spent the next 30 years making a meager salary off of his paintings. He had a few photographs published in the 1950's, but it wasn't until the 1960's that his work was shown to John Szarkowski at MoMA in New York and he became known as one of the great photographers of the 20th Century. Lartigue was near 70 by the time this happened.\n\n\t\t\t\tBook shown in this video:\n\t\t\t\tJacques Henri Lartigue http://amzn.to/289mCRy\n\n\t\t\t\tAlso recommended:\n\t\t\t\tLartigue: Life in Color http://amzn.to/289nfL4\n\n\n\t\t\t",

I've had several people since ask me about the camera settings that I am using on the Phantom 3.\n\n\t\t\t\tAerial photography and video work is similar to landscape in that you have a very wide dynamic range that you have to deal with. Its difficult to capture in digital format. The Phantom 3 features a Sony Exmor sensor… having said that it is a decent camera, but not incredible.

Works from the private collection of Keith de Lellis exhibit the new renaissance of post-WWII Italy. These works show the influence of the established street photography from photojournalists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, W Eugene Smith and Robert Frank. These influences are projected on to an Italian landscape here and represent photography that is quite unique and beautiful.\n\n\t\t\t\tAmazon http://amzn.to/1J3Fw2S\n\t\t\t\tPowell's http://goo.gl/dT2GS1\n\t\t\t\tHalf Price Books http://goo.gl/GyngfS\n\n\t\t\t\tSPONSOR\n\t\t\t\tSquarespace.com - Build It Beautiful\n\t\t\t\tFor a free trial and 10% off your subscription, visit http://squarespace.com and use offer code AOP on checkout.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTwitter: http://twitter.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\tInstagram: http://instagram.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\tFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/aop.podcast\n\t\t\t\tPinterest: http://pinterest.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\tWebsite: http://theartofphotography.tv\n\n\t\t\t\tAnd get on our mailing list to stay up to date on photography news and the latest episodes:\n\n\t\t\t\thttp://theartofphotography.tv/about/mailing-list/\n\n\t\t\t\tTed Forbes\n\t\t\t\tThe Art of Photography\n\t\t\t\t3100 Main St #135\n\t\t\t\tDallas, Texas 75226\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThanks for watching - if you like this video, remember to share it with your friends!\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMy name is Ted Forbes and I make videos about photography.

Possibly make you angry? Well get ready. In this video I’m going to give an overview of how the high-end art market works.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe art market has become very attractive to investors in recent years for a variety of reasons. According to Bloomberg, this has snowballed into a global $54 Billion industry. Who are the artists? Who are the investors? How does this work? These are some of the questions I will try to answer in this video.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe art market is rarely discussed in the media unless there is a lawsuit. I think that’s why its important to have this conversation. When it comes to huge money, very few of us understand how art as a business actually works.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t",

Sony has been putting this into cameras for a while now and my early experiences with built in Wifi were frustrating to say the least so I stopped even trying to use it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever - I decided to give it another shot recently. Sony have come a long way with wifi transfer of images. Its not perfect (and won't be until mobile devices support RAW), but for a number of things its actually quite useful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo get this to work you will need to download the free Sony Play Memories app. Its available for both Apple and Android devices. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis video explains how to connect the camera to your phone. This works smoothly on all my Sony cameras including the RX100 mark iii, the Sony a5100 and the Sony A7s.

            "description": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAutochrome Lumière was one of the first commercially available color processes. There were earlier processes, but Autochrome was very refined and \"realistic\" for the technology at the time. Using grains made of potato starch, these grains produced a 3 color space of Orange, Green and Violet to reproduce color.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the early years, Pictorialists embraced Autochrome and were fascinated by its results. But quickly, pictorialists rejected it because of its mechanica, \"pre-made\"l process and lack of hand control over the chemicals and techniques involved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAutochrome was produced until the 1940's, but its early years were the most interesting and prolific among photographers in the art world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMervyn O’Gorman from Petapixel http://petapixel.com/2015/04/26/these-1913-autochrome-portraits-are-from-the-early-days-of-color-photography/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBooks:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tImpressionist Camera: Pictorial Photography in Europe, 1888-1918\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1858943310/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1858943310&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=U4E64EZJAMYCS7ZQ\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeinrich Kuhn: The Perfect Photograph\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3775725695/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3775725695&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=H3LDYSF5LZBOJFMS\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeinrich Kuehn and His American Circle: Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3791351966/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3791351966&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=K7B6L3MW2TJTIT2O\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis episode is sponsored by QuickBooks Self-Employed.

            "description": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tNew55 has just released a chemical called R3 Monobath. It is just that, a 1 chemical process for developing film. I wanted to see for myself how well this worked so I ordered a few bottles and developed some film.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMonobath developers have been around for a long time. The first evidence I could find was a 1967 thesis by William Quan for RIT in Rochester. In his paper he described a 1 bath process for use with Panotomic X film (no longer made).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInstant films all use monobath for their chemicals which makes sense why New55 would be experimenting with this. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMonobath is not the perfect developer, but its very good in the right situation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe pros: 1 bath process, easy to use, beautiful contrast, nice grain\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe cons: contains ammonia (fumes are strong), is designed for a specific film type, no control for pushing, pulling or manipulating the look of the process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMy Monobath Sample Images: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedforbes/sets/72157650008473213/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBuy R3 Monobath from New55: http://shop.new55.net/collections/frontpage/products/r3-monobath-developer\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMake your own R3 Monobath: http://new55project.blogspot.com/2010/01/donal-qualls-successful-monobath.html\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWilliam Quan's thesis: http://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/5194/\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t",

            "title": "Tina Modotti",
            "datePublished": "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 02:33:54 +0000",
            "description": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tTina Modotti was born Assunta Adelaide Luigia Modotti Mondini in 1896. At the age of 16, she moved from her native Italy to the United States with her father. Modotti soon developed an interest in performing arts and appeared in several plays, operas and silent movies while living in San Francisco. Five years later, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film. Modotti became known for playing the femme fatale and in 1920 landed the staring role in The Tiger’s Coat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTina showed an interest in photography from an early age. Her uncle Pietro Modotti ran a photography studio in Italy and later her father ran a similar studio in San Fransisco. After moving to Los Angeles with her boyfriend Robo Richey, Tina soon became friends with Edward Weston. Weston became a mentor and inspiration for Modotti’s development as a fine art photographer an by 1921 she was modeling for Weston and the two soon began an affair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tModotti’s boyfriend, Robo went to Mexico in December of 1921. Unaware of Tina’s affair with Weston, he took a portfolio of Weston’s work hoping to work out an exhibition in Mexico. While Tina was on her way to Mexico to join him, she found that he had died 2 days before her arrival of smallpox. The following year, Tina mounted a two week exhibition of Robo’s and Weston’s work at the National Academy of Fine Arts in Mexico City.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWeston moved to Mexico the following year leaving behind his wife and 3 of 4 children. Tina set up and managed Edward’s studio in return for his mentoring her as a photographer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWeston was taken by Mexican culture and was inspired by local folk art and landscape. Modotti was more interested in people and the Modernest aesthetic. She soon found a community of cultural and political avant-gardists who she became closely associated with including Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAs her photography skills began to mature, Modotti’s work included lyrical images of peasants and workers and experiments with architectural interiors, flowers and urban landscapes. Mexican photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo notes 2 distinctions in Modotti’s work being both “romantic” and “revolutionary”. The romantic aspects of her work undoubtedly influenced by Weston and the revolutionary from her growing interest in politics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1926, Weston signed a contract with writer Anita Brenner to photograph her book on Mexican folk art. Modotti and Weston were joined by Edward’s son Brett. The job was quite large requiring over 400 8×10 negatives and prints. Brett was brought up to speed at a breakneck pace and learned how to make prints while traveling through Mexico in search of lesser known native art. The project took months and by the end, Edward’s relationship with Tina was over. At the end of the project, Edward and Brett returned permanently to California.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tModotti continued her works as a photographer and in 1929 did her first one-woman retrospective exhibition at the National Library which was advertised as the “First Revolutionary Photographic Exhibition In Mexico”. By this time, Tina had been a member of the Mexican Communist Party for several years and her work was very politically focused. In 1929, Modotti’s close friend Julio Antonia Mella was assassinated presumably by agents of the Cuban government. Soon there was an assassination attempt on Mexican President Pascual Ortiz Rubio and Modotti was questioned about both crimes. In 1930, she was expelled from Mexico as the result of an anti-communist and anti-imagrant press campaign. Modotti evaded police through Rotterdam, Berlin and Switzerland before making her way back to Italy to join the anti-fascist resistance before proceeding to Moscow in 1931. After this move to Russia no photographs survive and it is presumed that Moditti never photographed again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the rise of the Spanish Civil War, Modotti left Moscow for Spain. Following the collapse of the Republican movement, she returned to Mexico under a false identity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwo years later, Modotti died under somewhat suspicious circumstances though the official autopsy indicated heart failure. She was 46.\n\t\t\t\t\tine art photographer an by 1921 she was modeling for Weston and the two soon began an affair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMoMA Collection :: http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4039\n\t\t\t\t\tPhiladelphia Museum of Art Collections :: http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/results.html?searchTxt=modotti&keySearch=+Search+&searchNameID=&searchClassID=&searchOrigin=&searchDeptID=&accessionID=&page=1\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t",

I can tell you that in my 20 year career I've run across this offer of work for \"exposure\" more times than I'd have liked to. I've got some fairly strong opinions on this as well.

Because there is no mirror in the design, mirrorless cameras use electronic viewfinders. Because you’re composing your image with a screen, there is more you can do with assisting technology imposed on the screen to make your life easier.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tConfusing? Yes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first time I used a mirrorless camera I hated it. It felt like a gimmick with all the stuff on the screen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBut after sticking with it and applying some of the techniques that I use to shoot video to still photography – it actually works.

            "description": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Brandt is one of the more important photographers working in fine art today. His entire cause and mission is wrapped around stopping the rampant poaching problem in East Africa.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick photographs animals as portraits. He doesn't use telephoto lenses as he prefers to photograph his subjects as one would people. This is a painstaking practice that involves extreme patience and dedication and this shows clearly in the work he produces.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandt works in a hybrid film and digital process. He photographs using film on a Pentax 67 camera with modified lens (creating a soft focus, tilt-shift effect). The film is scanned and toned in the computer before the works are rendered as digital prints.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Brandt: http://www.nickbrandt.com/\n\t\t\t\t\tBig Life Foundation: https://biglife.org/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn This Earth: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811848655/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0811848655&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=7ODTGENWWADT7WPN\n\t\t\t\t\tA Shadow Falls: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081095415X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=081095415X&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=YPCSRYUC2VJBSTX3\n\t\t\t\t\tAcross the Ravaged Land: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419709453/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1419709453&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=7D3FGH3YQ4FFUMQS\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis episode is sponsored by Squarespace.

            "description": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSaul Leiter was one of the greatest undiscovered photographers of the 20th century. Working in New York as a fashion photographer, Saul Leiter amassed an amazing collection of personal work that came to the attention of Howard Greenberg in the 2000's. Before Saul's death - the release of \"Early Color\" changed Saul's career finally bringing the attention and praise he long deserved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year Greenberg/Steidl released a 2 volume book set called \"Early Black and White\". Divided into 2 volumes (I. Interior and II. Exterior), the portfolio shows a much different side of Saul. The images are just as beautiful as the Early Color work, but they are made with a completely different approach. In some ways they could have been done by a completely different photographer, but there's a hallmark of the style that is obviously classic Saul Leiter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe impressive part is that Saul treated black and white vs color as 2 different mediums. Much like an artist who paints and sculpts, the respect for these 2 \"mediums\" speaks to Saul's passion and respect for photography as well as his extraordinary talent as an artist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGet the book here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3865214134/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3865214134&linkCode=as2&tag=thepublbroa-20&linkId=XQTLHOONB2PTZ7DX\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe for more videos!\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=theartofphotography\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwitter: http://twitter.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\t\tInstagram: http://instagram.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\t\tFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/aop.podcast\n\t\t\t\t\tPinterest: http://pinterest.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\t\tWebsite: http://theartofphotography.tv\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWatch More Episodes:\n\t\t\t\t\tWho Influenced Saul Leiter?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9y_F7PSGss\n\t\t\t\t\tSaul Leiter - Early Color ::  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdIJkt3Gz8\n\t\t\t\t\tFred Herzog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6qv9o-Syuo\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd get on our mailing list to stay up to date on photography news and the latest episodes:\n\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://theartofphotography.tv/about/mailing-list/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks for watching - if you like this video, remember to share it with your friends!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTed Forbes\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Art of Photography\n\t\t\t\t\t3100 Main St #135\n\t\t\t\t\tDallas, Texas 75226\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMy name is Ted Forbes and I make videos about photography.

I obviously do a lot of video as well as stills so versatility is important to me as well. I didn't think I was going to find something that would work - I was wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Sony RX100 Mark III is a compact, point and shoot camera. It has a fixed Zeiss Vario-Sonnar (24-70mm equivalent), 20.1 MP sensor and uses the Sony BIONZ X Image processor and a popup OLED electronic viewfinder. It records HD video with Sony's new XAVC-S higher data-rate codec.

            "description": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Kiev 88 has long been hailed as the most inexpensive way to get into a medium format modular camera system. You can get an entire system for a fraction of what you'd pay for a Hasselblad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBut how is the quality? Is it worth it? Or is it easier to save a little more and upgrade to an actual Hasselblad rig?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've had mine for years. I've had 2 actually - the first one died on me. They are great, but you earn every shot you take. They are extremely finicky and awkward to use. I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about photography though when I first started shooting mine so I believe their value is in what you want out of a camera.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you're new to medium format or new to photography for that matter - you will learn a lot. And they are super cheap so its definitely an easy way to get into medium format.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Kiev 88 was produced in the Ukraine up until about 2009. There are third party companies that bought remaining inventory and modify them. Unfortunately this starts getting expensive so I still advocate the original model.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Kiev 88 is a copy of the Hasselblad 1000F. Originally known as the Salut - they later boasted a hot shoe and renamed the model the Kiev 80. A few more improvements lead to the classic Kiev 88 design.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've covered this camera on the show before, but not in a full deep dive review. Today we will finally do that!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tResources:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKiev 88 on Camerapedia - http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Kiev_88\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Arax Kiev 88 Site - http://araxfoto.com/cameras/\n\t\t\t\t\tMy original video on the Kiev 88 from 2012 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMA65LsLFg\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t",
