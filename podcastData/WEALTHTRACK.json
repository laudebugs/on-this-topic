The widely predicted blue wave of Democrats sweeping into the White House, taking over the Senate majority, and increasing their dominance in Congress has failed to materialize.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As far as the stock market is concerned, a divided government is a plus because not a lot will change in the way of tax policy and regulations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Investor optimism is not shared by Federal Reserve officials who expressed ongoing concern about the economy and the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in today’s Federal Open Market Committee policy announcement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year... “</p>\r\n<p>“The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.”</p>\r\n<p>Ongoing Fed stimulus is another reason Wall Street is bullish.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At WEALTHTRACK we realize that we do not invest in a vacuum. What is happening in the world around us affects the markets and companies we invest in, which is why macro matters.</p>\r\n<p>This week, in part 2 of our interview with financial thought leader, Jason Trennert we are going to identify some of the biggest trends that have been forming around us and are gaining momentum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Massive stimulus, big government, low-interest rates are three of the megatrends moving markets.

Today the Fed expects (more likely wishes) to see 4.0% just 4 years into this expansion. And since this cycle’s Drivers are leveraged to the Fed’s main policy tool - interest rates - the Fed’s in a good position to make it happen.”</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We will discuss why she is optimistic about the economy’s progress based on some unappreciated and under-reported trends she and her team have been tracking both pre-pandemic and now.

Not surprisingly, it has hurt them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to a survey of American workers with qualified retirement savings accounts, “...almost half (49%) &nbsp;had experienced a reduction in work income through job loss, or decrease in hours and/or a pay cut”.</p>\r\n<p>Also, “...workers who lost their jobs or experienced a drop in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic were at least twice as likely to take money from their qualified retirement savings accounts as those who weren’t impacted.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Retirement plans for older workers are particularly stressed. Not only do they have less time to make up any shortfalls, but seniors are more at risk from COVID-19 than younger people, so returning to work is more problematic. &nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Urban Institute, the combined rate of unemployment and underemployment for workers over 65 was 26% recently, much higher than for those between 25 and 54, and the largest gap on record. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How can we improve our retirement plans to withstand the current shock of this pandemic and future crises, which will inevitably occur? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This week we’ll be joined by one of WEALTHTRACK’s long-standing and most popular guests, &nbsp;retirement expert Mary Beth Franklin. &nbsp;Franklin is a Certified Financial Planner, award-winning personal finance journalist, Contributing Editor at InvestmentNews, and Author of “Maximizing Social Security Retirement Benefits.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Franklin explains what the pandemic has revealed about the state of retirement planning in the U.S., and how to best manage your own retirement in the current situation.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>WEALTHTRACK # 1711 originally broadcast on September 11, 2020</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>More Info: https://wealthtrack.com/how-covid-is-affecting-retirement-with-retirement-benefits-expert-mary-beth-franklin/</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Maximizing Social Security Retirement Benefits: http://www.investmentnews.com/MBFebook</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Surveys &amp; Articles:</p>\r\n<p>https://www.limra.com/en/newsroom/industry-trends/2020/secure-retirement-institute-covid-19-related-job-loss-or-income-reductions-drive-americans-to-tap-their-retirement-savings/</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/business/retirement-coronavirus.html</p>\r\n<p>17</p>\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support</a><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=rrQgRobwwTg:XY-RbMrG3vM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=rrQgRobwwTg:XY-RbMrG3vM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?i=rrQgRobwwTg:XY-RbMrG3vM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/trillianmedia/JVWE/~4/rrQgRobwwTg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

The huge, largely government-induced shutdown of global commerce ended the record-breaking economic recovery and the bull market in the U.S. The massive monetary and fiscal stimulus in response led to the shortest bear market in history and what could turn out to be the briefest recession ever - the jury is still out on this.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>To make sense of these changes, we are turning to a great investor Bill Miller, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Miller Value Partners.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>This week, in the first of a two-part interview, Miller and I discuss how the world has and has not changed since the pandemic struck.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WEALTHTRACK Episode #1701 broadcast on July 03, 2020</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>More Info: https://wealthtrack.com/a-rare-in-depth-interview-with-great-investor-bill-miller-on-what-the-pandemic-has-changed/</strong></p>\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support</a><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=dlEVV4YEPHk:3riiatJfelE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=dlEVV4YEPHk:3riiatJfelE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?i=dlEVV4YEPHk:3riiatJfelE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/trillianmedia/JVWE/~4/dlEVV4YEPHk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

He has widely followed economist, David Rosenberg, President, Chief Economist and Strategist at <a href=\"https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/about\"><u>Rosenberg Research &amp; Associates</u></a>,</p>\r\n<p>Last week, in Part I of our interview, he told us the economy was already going into a recession when the pandemic hit, that it has dramatically deepened, and that unless there is a vaccine soon, which he doubts will happen, that the damage will be lasting.</p>\r\n<p>This week, in Part 2 of our interview with Rosenberg, he focuses on the markets. He says it is impossible to reconcile one of the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression with the recent biggest 50-day post bear market rally in the S&amp;P 500’s history and that something has to give. Despite the market’s impressive performance since the March lows, he remains bearish, calling the experience a classic bear market rally.

After a decade which resulted in longevity records being set by both the economic recovery and bull market this black swan event was a stunner which requires a reassessment and regrouping of life plans, particularly for seniors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The most important actions we can take are to have a plan to protect what we have, live within our means and limit the drawdowns from already battered portfolios. How do we find the right financial advisor to help us do that? That is one of the questions we will answer in this week’s WEALTHTRACK.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One lesson we learned from the last financial crisis and recession was panic selling resulted in permanent losses. Investors who kept their targeted stock allocation benefitted from the eventual market recovery.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another lesson learned was the value of Social Security. No matter what happens in the market it is the one guaranteed, an inflation-adjusted annuity that most working Americans are entitled to. The longer Americans can delay collecting that benefit, until age 70 if possible, the bigger the lifetime payout is.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That is a point upon which our two guests heartily agree.

For the fourth year in a row, First Eagle’s Matthew McLennan is doing the honors.</p>\r\n<p>This week we are presenting the second of our two-part series focused on the global economic and investment outlook. In case you missed it, we tackled the 2020 prospects for the U.S. economy and markets last week which you can see on <a href=\"https://wealthtrack.com/positive-2020-outlook-for-us-economy-says-wall-streets-1-economist-ed-hyman/\"><u><strong>WEALTHTRACK.com</strong></u></a> or our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HvL1eNdQHO8\"><u>YouTube channel.&nbsp;</u></a></p>\r\n<p>In part one of our 2020 Outlook edition, Hyman predicted, as he did accurately for 2019, that the longest economic recovery on record in the U.S. would continue. He sees no signs of recession and believes that growth will actually pick up! He also forecasts that Wall Street will continue to climb a wall of worry, which he will describe in detail.</p>\r\n<p>Matt McLennan is not as optimistic. One of his main concerns is the record levels of government and corporate debt in the U.S. and the problems it poses to future growth and liquidity, especially in the event of a slowdown. After the record-setting bull market run he also believes the U.S. market is expensive. He is investing very selectively in super high quality, market-dominant companies. He has a stash of cash to take advantage of sizable market declines and a significant position in gold to offset market risk.</p>\r\n<p>We will start our global outlook discussion this week with one of the biggest headline events of 2019 - Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “Get Brexit Done” victory in the United Kingdom which Hyman thinks has worldwide significance.</p>\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support</a><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=Lf6il5tlPFQ:Tz9No288doU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=Lf6il5tlPFQ:Tz9No288doU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?i=Lf6il5tlPFQ:Tz9No288doU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/trillianmedia/JVWE/~4/Lf6il5tlPFQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

We are running part 2 this weekend.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRosenberg had been predicting the end of both the record-breaking U.S. recovery and bull market this year. Needless-to-say it hasn’t happened, and he is the first to admit he missed this year’s impressive run in large-cap stocks as a result. However, his recommendation to own long-term Treasury bonds has paid off. Year-to-date the 30-year has delivered about a 20% return.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRosenberg who is known for seeing emerging economic patterns before most others do, sometimes a couple of years early, is sticking to his guns in forecasting that a U.S. recession is imminent and is very concerned about the damage the record-breaking load of U.S. and global debt, what he&nbsp; calls “the mother of all credit bubbles on steroids” will have when it occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat was intended as one session with us turned into two because he had so much evidence to share about global and domestic conditions and the state of the financial markets.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLast week he made his case for recession. This week his focus extends to the markets and recession resilient investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs we mentioned last week, Rosenberg is launching his own macro research and strategy firm in January, <a href=\"https://wealthtrack.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5145643fcb0200e3638425ab1&amp;id=202afda26a&amp;e=36ec892d12\" target=\"_blank\">Rosenberg Research and Associates</a>.

But the cumulative real growth of the economy, that’s excluding inflation, is far below other post World War II recoveries.</p>\r\n<p>That growth is now being challenged on several fronts - enough to derail the U.S. economy and the record-breaking bull market in large-cap stocks?</p>\r\n<p>In a slow-growth world, growth commands a premium. Large-cap growth stocks, particularly the largest U.S. ones known as mega-caps have dominated market performance, revenues, and earnings over the last decade with a few short-lived challenges from value stocks. Will they continue to do so?</p>\r\n<p>This week’s guest is a newcomer to WEALTHTRACK, but not to the investment business. She is Margaret Vitrano, Co-Portfolio Manager of the high performing <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/sblgx/quote\"><u>ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund</u></a></p>\r\n<p>Vitrano and her Co-Portfolio Manager Peter Bourbeau also oversee <a href=\"https://www.leggmason.com/en-us/products/managed-accounts/clearbridge-all-cap-growth-portfolios.html\"><u>ClearBridge’s All Cap Growth Strategies</u></a> along with Large Cap Growth which adds up to nearly $50 billion under management.</p>\r\n<p>Of particular interest is the team's “three-bucket” approach strategy to large-cap growth which Vitrano believes has protected their portfolios in down markets.

You need to know how to make it work for you.</p>\r\n<p>A shocking statistic from Medicare guru Katy Votava is that “nearly 95% of people pay too much for their Medicare coverage… because they do not completely understand the full costs they will pay in addition to the premiums.”&nbsp; With Medicare, the devil is in the details which is why we have asked benefits guru Votava to return to WEALTHTRACK and bring us up to speed.</p>\r\n<p>WEALTHTRACK # 1614 broadcast on October 04, 20219.</p>\r\n<p>More Info: <a href=\"http://wealthtrack.com/?p=20590\">http://wealthtrack.com/?p=20590</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>MEDICARE RESOURCES</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"Medicare.gov\">Medicare.gov</a> – The official U.S. Government site for Medicare<br>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>1-800-MEDICARE</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"Shiptacenter.org\">Shiptacenter.org</a> – The State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) site that directs consumers to free Medicare counseling and assistance<br>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support</a><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=PlLPmciuXeE:dkDpK1z2M7I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?a=PlLPmciuXeE:dkDpK1z2M7I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/trillianmedia/JVWE?i=PlLPmciuXeE:dkDpK1z2M7I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/trillianmedia/JVWE/~4/PlLPmciuXeE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

We also want to, “Show you the money,” Tom Cruise’s mantra in JERRY MAGUIRE.</p>\r\n<p>We can do both with one investment approach. Socially responsible investing, also known as ESG (for Environmental, Social and Governance), sustainable or impact investing. It is attracting massive amounts of investor dollars - follow the money - and is performing as well if not better than non-ESG investments - showing you the money!</p>\r\n<p>The latest evidence comes from Morningstar. In its most recent “Sustainable Funds U.S. Landscape Report” Morningstar found that the ESG fund group “attracted record net flows in 2018,” its sixth year of “ever higher annual net flows” while non- ESG U.S. funds “collected less than half their historic annual… average” of the last 10 years. And sustainable funds relative performance remained strong, even in the challenging environment of 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Environmental impact investing is attracting dollars and delivering results.

The futures markets, however, are betting on a change in policy toward more easing. The Federal-Funds futures were recently pricing in a 40% chance of one rate cut this year, an expectation several Fed officials were quick to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The bond market is signaling possible trouble ahead. For the first time since 2007 long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell below short-term rates, as measured by the yield on 3-month Treasury bills. Known as an inverted yield curve it is considered to be a reliable indicator of recession.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This week’s WEALTHTRACK exclusive guest has long been warning of subpar economic growth globally and the risks inherent in this recovery.
