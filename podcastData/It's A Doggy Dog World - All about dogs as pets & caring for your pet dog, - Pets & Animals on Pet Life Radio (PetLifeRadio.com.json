When we discuss breeds and mixes, we’ll take a look at what constitutes a breed or a mix; and the traits of some specific breeds. We’ll also take a look at how you can choose the right breed and dog for your family. \n\n\n\nWe will also talk about the joys (and hassles) of living with a dog because when we share our lives with dogs, we are bringing another species into our home and there are often misunderstandings and miscommunications... on Pet Life Radio.",

The first was about using a crate and whether it really was a good training tool. Liz, Petra and Kate talk about how long a dog should be asked to stay in a crate and some options for longer time periods. Katie then asked about bringing home a puppy, an adolescent, or an adult and the hosts talk about pros and cons of each. Since Katie and her husband will be first time dog owners, that's discussed too.

            "description": "Dogs can have disabilities of many kinds, from blindness, deafness, the loss of a limb, hip dysplasia and more. Some disabilities come with old age, some may be due to injuries and other may be congenital defects. As much as we may feel sorry for the dog with a disability, our dogs don't need that pity. Dogs don't pout about their disabilities; they just get on with life. However, you can help your dog live a quality life in many different ways.

The holidays have hazards, too, of course, from the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving dinner to the decorations on the Christmas tree. After all, to puppy, those bright bolored balls on the Christmas tree look just like the balls he plays with – just shinier! In this show, Liz, Petra and Kate offer some advice on how to keep your canine best friend safe.

Although we don’t have a problem with mixed breeds dogs; we’ve all owned mixed breeds, we do have a problem when the new owners of these dogs have unrealistic expectations. I also feel that people are paying way too much money for these mixed breed dogs; especially when there are so many in the local shelters and humane societies who can be adopted for very reasonable prices.
