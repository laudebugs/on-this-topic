Corporations and organizations constantly feel the pressure to maximize operation efficiency while maintaining an appropriate level of cyber security, and it becomes a juggling act that some inevitably fail. We chat about the shift of every industry towards cloud storage and away from physical servers and how that affects security. There is definitely a human error factor as well, but that doesn't mean we should give cyber security professionals a free pass, it is their job to keep the public's information secure. So that leaves it up to us to do our part, as much as we hate it, by changing our passwords often, viewing email proposals or pleas for help with a healthy level of suspicion, and keeping our credit card information secure online.

Solo, Brent Butterworth, talk about the phenomenon called 'eardrum suck'. This painful, psychosomatic condition afflicts some users of high end noise cancelling headphones, but thankfully the new Bose NC 700 Headphones have a remedy. These $399 replacements for the Bose QuietComfort 35 II get high marks from Brent, who claims they are more comfortable, sound better, and have adjustable levels of noise cancellation. We also chat about the oversaturation of the headphone market after Chinese manufacturers decided to start marketing their own products; like Haomeja who promise \"Supercar loud boom sounds.\" Changing topics, we discuss the recent, and rampant, 'Agent Smith' malware afflicting millions of Android devices and how to use best practices to avoid contracting such technological afflictions. Closing up the show we discuss Amazon's new Lord of the Rings prequel TV series and multiplayer video game, as well as the oncoming deluge of new streaming services.

Then, we chat with Consumer Columnist for The Los Angeles Times, David Lazarus, about the cable companies stranglehold on regional broadband internet services and how things got to be the way they are. We also explore how the shift of TV consumers from bloated cable TV packages to cord cutting streaming services is making internet service providers (ISPs) charge more to offset their losses; but that doesn't mean these price hikes are justified. David offers a case for having more regulation in the telecommunications industry, not necessarily in a heavy handed sense, but we at least need a referee on the field or an adult in the room.

Mike Etchart waxes poetic about the glory days of eBay in the early 2000s and what a revelation it was to be able to find rare items previously only found through exhaustive garage saling and swap meeting. Alas, all good things fade, and as Amazon.com rose to prominence, eBay's success waned; and what wondrous, unexpected avenues Amazon would follow in the age of digital voice assistants. The Washington Post Tech Columnist, Geoffrey Fowler, recently wrote an article detailing his experience with the 'big three' of smart speakers - Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. While each assistant has their quirks, pitfalls, and triumphs, one speaker stands above all. Geoffrey describes how Amazon was able to claim the top spot from competitors that, at first glance, should have had an upper hand in the space. Then, ERN Production Assistant, Cody Castleberry, details his experience out among the throngs of Black Friday (or rather, Black Thursday) shoppers. The decline of brick-and-mortar sales is apparent, as less intensive crowds are gathered in checkout lines year by year. We close the show with a few Cyber Monday statistics that may be surprising, and a discussion about the convenience of sharing your information contrasting the price of admission for a private, more exclusive Apple ecosystem.

Then, Geoff Morrison tells us why heavily discounted televisions during the Black Friday weekend aren't as good of deals as we may be lead to believe. Next, we dive into how TVs have gotten as inexpensive as they have due to the natural progression of manufacturing technology. Changing topics, Geoff describes why Insta360's One X is the best camera on the market.

We begin the hour with an analysis of the 2018 Apple World Wide Developers Conference which placed a significant emphasis on software upgrades. Notably, iOS 12 will continue to work on legacy devices, FaceTime can now accommodate up to 32 simultaneous users per session with an added Animoji filter option, and new devices will support Dolby Atmos for next-level surround sound. With sweet tunes top of mind, we learn how Apple Music will stack up against competing for streaming applications such as Spotify. Changing focus, The Wire Cutter's Geoff Morrison delves into the evolution of television technology. While most modern TVs are offered in HDR, your viewing experience will vary greatly depending on the set's resolution. Geoff also goes in depth describing the differences between 2K, 4K, and 8K TVs. Lastly, Geoff tells us about the newest broadcasting standard that will be here by winter of 2020; ATSC 3.0 will deliver Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos over the air for free, and will most likely have a box that you integrate into your current entertainment system.

We begin the hour with the Co-Founder of the Augmented World Expo, Ori Inbar, who discusses how the expo has evolved in the last nine years. There will be over 400 speakers (100 of which are women) and 250 exhibitors that will be displaying the latest in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). For anywhere from $49-$1000 (depending on the package you want), you can attend the expo and explore the wonderful advancements that have been made in the AR world. While this event is open to the public, it mostly attracts professionals that are working or wanting to work in the industry. If you're interested in discovering more about what the future holds for AR and VR, you don't want to miss this. Switching gears, we talk with Chris Heille, Director of Product Innovation of Zivix LLC, about their latest Indiegogo campaign for the Jamstik 7 and Jamstik 12. After the success of the original Jamstik and the Jamstik Plus, the team decided that they really needed to take these musical products to the next level. These new models of the Jamstik will feature seven or twelve frets (model specific) and the updated software will make it possible to use them not only on Apple products but Windows friendly machines as well. They will come equipped with MIDI Bluetooth and a USB port to connect to the device of your choice. The Jamstik 7, which was designed specifically for beginners will be priced, unbundled, at around $249 and the 12 at $279.

NAMM (the National Association of Music Merchants) showcases the newest, coolest tech, alongside the best classics in the music world. First, we chat with Universal Audio Product Specialist, Tom Waterman, about their part in the birth of the modern recording industry. Then, VP of Sales Operations for Roland, Robin Kelly, tells the story of when the TR-808 was first released, from failure to underground success. Next, we chat with Survios Director of Marketing, Hunter Kitagawa, about their new VR music creation experience, Electronauts. Former Chairman of NAMM, Dennis Houlihan, discusses the robust future of retail in the music industry and how musicians want a place to touch and play an instrument before they buy. Also, James 'McGoo' McGregor fills us in on his new app, PLNIFY, that makes your life as a traveling team easy. QSC Product Manager of Pro PA Loudspeakers, Chris Brouelette, describes how they've made PA and amplification tech compact and lightweight for the modern age. Then, Del Breckenfeld tells us about his charity benefit with the band, Gambler. Premier Guitar Publisher and Managing Director, Jon Levy, gives us some insight on the duality of musicians interest, and Fender's wacky guitar on display in their booth.
