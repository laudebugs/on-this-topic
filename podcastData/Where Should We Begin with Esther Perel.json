You can listen to all episodes right now for free on Spotify and weekly everywhere else. https://smarturl.it/hows-work\n\nIn this episode, friends and fellow dancers at a strip club: one brings years of experience, the other a youthful energy that turns angry at times. They’re here to talk about boundaries that are crossed, educating “civilians\" about their work, family acceptance, and how they'll transition from the sex work industry into professional careers.
