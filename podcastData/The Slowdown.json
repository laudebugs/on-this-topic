She explains\n\nsomething about blood, how to salt\n\tthe raw bird to drain its fluids,\n\t\tbut my mind already wanders:\n\nI watch the chicken shrivel but compose\n\tinstead the grandfather I’ve only met\n\t\tin story: daybreak, he’s just finished\n\nmopping up in the buildings\n\tthat sculpt this city’s skyline, but it’s\n\t\tsomeone else’s view of Los Angeles.\n\nThe immigrant sees, not the postcard-perfect lights,\n\tbut the scuffed tiles, dust-lined desks, the darkening\n\t\tthroats of toilet after toilet.\n\nHome, he tiptoes upstairs not to wake\n\this daughters, holding his shoes\n\t\tlike a thief. He’s fired\n\nfor stealing a roll of toilet paper, a can of soda\n\tfor my mother. Children are nothing\n\t\tbut trouble, my grandmother says,\n\nshaking a wooden spoon. My mother claims\n\tthe story otherwise: it was she \n\t\twho accompanied father to work, she\n\nwho stole a box of stale donuts, she\n\twho lost the family’s first job. Grandmother\n\t\tshrugs and repeats the same\n\nconclusion. Never have children, she says, \n\tthough her expression is hidden \n\t\tby the steam now rising from the pot.\n\nIt’s a simple recipe: boil until the meat\n\tfalls from the bones, easy, like a girl\n\t\tshedding a summer dress.\n\nLast night, I cooked for friends.\n\tAfter dinner, my friend handed me \n\t\this one-month son, who only\n\nblinked when I nudged my thumb\n\tinto his fist. Earlier, washing the pale\n\t\tbird, I struggled to keep the body\n\nfrom slipping through my hands: I held\n           its small-fleshed form under cold water,\n\t\t      pulled the giblets out the round hollow\n\nbetween its ribs and was surprised\n\tto be surprised when it didn’t\n\t\tmake a sound. </pre>\n<p><em>&quot;Lesson: Chicken Soup&quot; by Christine Kitano, from </em><em><a href=\"https://www.boaeditions.org/products/sky-country\" class=\"default\">SKY COUNTRY</a></em><em> by Christine Kitano, copyright © 2017 Christine Kitano.
