Your hosts begin by discussing the upset-heavy results from Sunday, then profile their booms and busts of the week, including some busts who might qualify as buy-lows. From there, the conversation pivots to the viability of \"buying low.\" It's harder than ever, and your hosts speculate on how traders can find edges when the modern fantasy player is so well-informed. Then it's on to the impact of key injuries from Week 10, including those to Matthew Stafford, Austin Hooper, Brian Allen, Marshon Lattimore, and Patrick Peterson. The show winds down with waiver pick-up recommendations for each position (26:32). Who is the best bargain basement QB streamer? Is Brian Hill or Derrius Guice the better RB addition? Do we need to pay attention to Darrel Williams or Darwin Thompson? How about Russell Gage? Is O.J. Howard's fantasy value back from the dead? Who are the best streaming defenses for Week 11?

He kicks off the show discussing the impact of injuries and byes on the transactions leading up to Week 7, then he wonders if home field advantage in the NFL is largely dead. Booms of the week and busts of the week are next, with a lot of time spent on surprising performances from the Lions, Cardinals, and Saints. From there, Greg dives into key injuries from Week 7 (19:29). Can the Chiefs' offense maintain high-level fantasy production with Matt Moore under center? How about the Falcons with Matt Schaub at quarterback? Injuries from other positions are also discussed, and those lead right into Greg's assessment of the Week 8 waiver wire (24:27). Which handcuff running backs are most likely to break out next ala Chase Edmonds in Week 7? Do fantasy owners need to give serious consideration to Mark Walton and Brandon Bolden? Is Anthony Miller finally coming around? What's it going to take for DeVante Parker and Preston Williams to crack 25% ownership? Is there any hope left for O.J. Howard? And if not, which other tight ends might offer non-zero production off waivers? Greg tackles all these questions and more, so tune and help make sure he wasn't just talking to himself that whole time.</p><p>The show is brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.fantasydraft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FantasyDraft</a>.

Will the workload for Jamaal Williams ramp back up in spite of Aaron Jones' recent success? Will Brandon Bolden ever go away? How can we mine value from San Francisco's receiving corps? Is there any hope for tight ends off the waiver wire? Will Ryan Tannehill generate fantasy value in Tennessee? Is Jacoby Brissett or Daniel Jones the better streamer for Week 7?

Tight end is next, with Greg and Holden weighing a handful of fringy performers against Chris Herndon returning from suspension.

They begin by discussing how to navigate bye weeks, as well as how to adjust your waiver approach after you've spent most of your FAAB. Then it's on to the various positions, beginning with running backs before moving on to wide receivers, tight ends, quarterbacks, and team defenses. How will James White's return impact Rex Burkhead's fantasy value? What percentage of your remaining FAAB is Wayne Gallman worth? Which handcuff-type running backs have the most value off waivers? Would Deon Cain or Parris Campbell be the primary beneficiary if T.Y. Hilton misses time?  Why isn't Kenny Stills owned in more leagues? Does Auden Tate matter? How about Demetrius Harris and Dawson Knox? How are we applying the small amount on data we have on newly appointed starting quarterbacks to our Week 4 waiver decisions?
