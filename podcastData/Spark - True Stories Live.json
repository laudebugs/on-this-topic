Then we hear from event producer Rachel who talks us through a psychotic episode she once had without realising she was having it.

I’d thought we’d seen it all to be honest but in January this year, Peter McCleave took to the stage and asked us to save his life. That was a first. </p><p><br></p><p>In 2016 Peter, a thirty nine year old triathlete and father of two, was diagnosed with a blood cancer called Myeloma and given seven years to live. Two years in, he now has five. But that doesn’t have to be the case. All Peter needs is someone who is a genetic match to donate their stem cells. In fact, that’s all most people in Peter’s situation need in order to survive. Trouble is around only two percent of the UK’s population is on the stem cell donation register. So Peter is on a mission to get that number up. </p><p><br></p><p>Getting on the register is simple, pain free and could save someone’s life, so why not register today?
