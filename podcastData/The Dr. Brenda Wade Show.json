But Dr. Jeanne Sanner says women still need to do more.\r\n\r\nSome would say she has a controversial take, that women for their own sake need to\r\n\r\nforgive their sexual harassers—the Bill O’Reillys and Harvey Weinsteins who betrayed\r\n\r\ntheir trust.\r\n\r\nJeanne says it is important for women who have been victimized to change their own\r\n\r\nperceptions of the event and to stop condemning the men.\r\n\r\nAfter she was raped by a stranger, Jeanne told herself, “He may have controlled my\r\n\r\nbody but he will not have control of my life.” She took back her power by choosing love\r\n\r\nover fear.\r\n\r\nShe is the author of the upcoming book “Finding Unconditional Love a Little Peace at a\r\n\r\nTime.” Jeanne has a doctorate in spiritual studies, a master’s in education and a\r\n\r\nbachelor’s in psychology.

Race and education were traditionally what we used to look for in potential partners. But now political affiliation is having a great effect.\r\n\r\nTonight’s show is about the devastating effect the presidential campaign has had on personal relationships. What do you do when someone you love has a dramatically different political view? Facebook research reveals a whopping 34% of its users report de-friending someone over a political post this year. No matter which candidate ultimately wins the presidential election, some friendships will never be the same. Psychoanalyst Frieda Birnbaum is here to share why this election—more than previous ones—is causing more stress on relationships and whether losing a friend because of political differences is an indication that the friendship wasn’t a strong one to begin with.\r\n\r\nBased in New York City, Dr Frieda is a research psychologist and author of “What Price Power: An In-Depth Study of the Professional Woman in a Relationship.” She’s an expert on depression, women’s issues, and attaining happiness.

Trained in Internal Medicine, Dr. Valerie Youngblood says if you change your perception about aging, your body will follow.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of practice, Dr. Valerie became disillusioned with traditional managed care and intuitively knew there was a better way. She became one of the first doctors to be certified in integrative holistic medicine changing her method of practice toward viewing a person in totality, treating the root cause of dis-ease and restoring balance.\r\n\r\nDr. Valerie says this is 21st century medicine called Functional Medicine and it will be the fundamental method of practicing medicine in the future that can be accessed NOW.\r\n\r\nShe regularly holds seminars, workshops and retreats speaking on the keys to living a balanced healthy lifestyle. Her new book, The Youngblood Code is out now. You will be able to find it on at her website, www.vyoungbloodmd.com, Amazon and a bookstore near you.\r\n",

And how much stronger would your relationship be if you could “listen like a dog?” Dogs instinctively know not to interrupt us, finish our sentences, and offer unsolicited advice or text us instead of talking to us. And if we’re smart, asserts best-selling author Jeff Lazarus, we’ll strive to be more like them.\r\n\r\nCiting a Cornell study’s finding that we have one-third fewer good friends now than we did before social media came along, Jeff will share the mistakes we make when we think we are communicating. A health science consultant with an MBA from Pepperdine University, Jeff taught public speaking at the university level and conducted numerous workshops on listening, presentation skills, and customer engagement.\r\n\r\nHis new book “Listen Like a Dog” was inspired by his late dog Roamy and is the  follow-up to his #1 bestseller, “Dogtology.” The book’s website is www.listenlikeadog.com.\r\n",

Other side effects include: better sleep, improved focus and concentration, enhanced memory, genuine confidence, visible smiling, audible laughter, positivity, and physical healing.\"\r\n\r\nThe website is www.icheatatmeditation.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n",

            "description": "A real-life political thriller about an American financier in the Wild East of Russia, the murder of his principled young tax attorney, and his dangerous mission to expose the Kremlin’s corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nBill Browder’s journey started on the South Side of Chicago and moved through Stanford Business School to the dog-eat-dog world of hedge fund investing in the 1990s. It continued in Moscow, where Browder made his fortune heading the largest investment fund in Russia after the Soviet Union’s collapse. But when he exposed the corrupt oligarchs who were robbing the companies in which he was investing, Vladimir Putin turned on him and, in 2005, had him expelled from Russia. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, a group of law enforcement officers raided Browder’s offices in Moscow and stole $230 million of taxes that his fund’s companies had paid to the Russian government. Browder’s attorney Sergei Magnitsky investigated the incident and uncovered a sprawling criminal enterprise. A month after Sergei testified against the officials involved, he was arrested and thrown into pre-trial detention, where he was tortured for a year. On November 16, 2009, he was led to an isolation chamber, handcuffed to a bedrail, and beaten to death by eight guards in full riot gear. \r\n\r\n\r\nBrowder glimpsed the heart of darkness, and it transformed his life: he embarked on an unrelenting quest for justice in Sergei’s name, exposing the towering cover-up that leads right up to Putin. A financial caper, a crime thriller, and a political crusade, Red Notice is the story of one man taking on overpowering odds to change the world. - See more at: http://books.simonandschuster.com/Red-Notice/Bill-Browder/9781476755717#sthash.33OnZC9p.dpuf\r\n",

Having been gifted with an inheritance, Richard used it to go on a decade long worldwide search for truth and meaning. He studied with great teachers in the East, traveled through the Himalayas, the Pacific and the Americas. He worked in the film industry in Australia, trained as a teacher of Chi Kung in Thailand and sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on a small yacht. During this time he lived in Manhattan, Oregon and Hawaii before finally returning to the UK in 1998, where he met Marian his wife. Over the following years they had 3 children and moved to Devon in southern England. Throughout his adventures Richard has explored his love of writing and in 2006 he won the FISH international poetry award in Ireland.\r\n\r\nRichard’s mystical journey began early in life as he experienced strange energies rushing throughout his body. This phenomenon catalysed his spiritual search. All his studies became synthesised in 2002 when he began to write and receive the Gene Keys. It took seven years to write the book and understand its teachings and applications. Today Richard continues to study and teach the profound lessons contained in the Gene Keys.\r\n",

You will learn how to put your aging accelerator into reverse and transform your life. You can increase your life expectancy and significantly improve the quality of your life by the actions you take. The secret is there is no secret! This is not about a quick fix; it is about easing your way into a long-term, sustained lifestyle. You can bypass normal aging, but first you have to address the disconnect between your wishes and your actions and change your life’s journey for good. How do you do this? Four key drivers work together synergistically to turbo-charge your success: Knowledge - you cannot solve a problem if you don’t know you have one. Nutrition - restrictive diets don’t work and are difficult to sustain in the long-term. Instead, focus on good balanced nutrition, which means more fresh whole foods you can enjoy and far less junk and processed foods. Exercise - is critical and the secret sauce to a long, high-quality life. Three of our major health problems—obesity, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s—are underpinned by the inactivity epidemic. The X Factor - is arguably the most important of all, and the easy-to-remember acronym RECIPE provides its six key ingredients. Armed with the X Factor you will succeed! There is one thing you can’t afford not to have as a high priority in your life and that is YOU! If you follow the advice in The eXercise Factor you too can enjoy a long, high-quality life. “You don’t have to be fit and healthy to start, but you do have to start to be fit and healthy.” www.TheeXerciseFactor.com\r\n",

These changes have marked an evolution in what I want from this life. I am what I want. What I seek to consume, possess, and achieve is a mirror that reflects my lusts and cravings, values and priorities, and moral boundaries or lack thereof. I am happy to say that what I want today is much less toxic and self-centered than what I used to want. It's taken decades of selfexamination to peel back the layers and figure out what really makes me happy. And while I'm still searching for my ultimate bliss, I know for sure it's not what I once thought it was. It's not alcohol, cigarettes, money, food, sugar, or status symbols: I've consumed all of those in massive quantities, and they've just made me miserable. Now, I want what can't be tasted, smoked, worn, seen, or counted. It's the opposite of material. As sappy as it might sound, what I want is spiritual.'\r\n\r\n—From the Introduction\r\n\r\nIn iWant, Jane Velez-Mitchell shares her candid and engaging story of the true adventure of her life, a journey of self-discovery that is still in full throttle.

Having worked as a corporate insider on four continents over a 20 year period before, she taps into both her business acumen and deep spiritual awareness to connect with her clients and help them reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nWithin her coaching practice, Jennifer works with successful individuals from a wide range of creative, corporate, and entrepreneurial backgrounds who seek deeper meaning in their lives and who wish to overcome blocks that may be keeping them from being fully happy and at peace. Her worldwide client base spans from Sydney to New York, Los Angeles to Monaco, Singapore, London, and all kinds of places in between.\r\n\r\nAs women and men continued to seek her out for help in understanding the complexities of their personal, professional, and intimate relationships, Jennifer developed a truly unique theory of what makes people tick. Over the years, she began to see more and more of the same ‘types’ emerging, as clients explained the challenges they faced each day at home and at work.

            "description": "Tom Gagliano has worn many hats throughout his career. As a young man, he soon became a successful entrepreneur with a proven track record in small business ventures in the greater New York area. About ten years ago, Tom started to spend less time in the business world and more time helping those who suffered from negative childhood messages. To pursue a dream of helping others, he returned to school to receive an MSW at age 51. His book, The Problem Was Me: How to End Negative Self-Talk and Take Your Life to a New Level, with Dr. Abraham Twerski, is one-of-a-kind. It explores how we sabotage the happiness in our lives simply because we are so afraid of intimacy. We become our own worst enemy as we subconsciously push away our loved ones. Tom helps people understand why we push others away so we can enhance the intimacy in our lives.\r\n\r\nToday Tom is a life coach, published author, and a key note speaker with a Master’s degree in social work. He was a bully as a kid and a recovering addict. He eventually went to addictions to medicate his problems. He realized at an early age he needed to fix what was broken inside of him. He then had two goals. One he wanted to give his children what his father couldn’t give me, A SAFE PLACE TO SHARE their FEELINGS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE. Next he wanted to help others silence that destructive inner voice they grew up with. Today he facilitates men and women’s groups as well as marriage consultations explaining the ways to give parents the tools to give their children the positive and loving messages that may have been denied to them in their childhood.\r\n\r\nHis website is www.theproblemwasme.com.\r\n\r\nDr. Wade is clinical psychologist, author, TV host, and motivational speaker, who inspires thousands of people each month with her dynamic range of events and free teleseminar's.\r\n",

And, ultimately, she explains why an affair is more about the betrayl of the self than it is about breaking marriage vows.

Loving ourselves and others is in our genetic code. It’s nothing other than the purpose of our lives—but knowing that doesn’t make it easy to do. We may find it a challenge to love ourselves. We may have a hard time letting love in from others. We’re often afraid of getting hurt. It is also sometimes scary for us to share love with those around us—and love that isn't shared leaves us feeling flat and unfulfilled. \r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Richo provides the tools here for learning how to love in evolved adult ways—beginning with getting past the barriers that keep us from loving ourselves, then showing how we can learn to open to love others. \r\n\r\nRicho provides wisdom from Buddhism, psychology, and a range of spiritual traditions, along with a wealth of practices both for avoiding the pitfalls that can occur in love relationships and for enhancing the way love shows up in our lives. He then leads us on to love’s inevitable outcome: developing a heart that loves universally and indiscriminately. This transcendent and unconditional love isn’t just for a heroic few, Richo shows, it’s everyone’s magnificent calling.\r\n\r\nDr. Wade is clinical psychologist, author, TV host, and motivational speaker, who inspires thousands of people each month with her dynamic range of events and free teleseminar's.\r\n",
