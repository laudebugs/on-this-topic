I call it Hugot Radio. We play the best easy listening music 24/7. With more than 9000 Fans on Facebook and counting!\n\nInformation:\n\nHugot (pronounced as Who-Goat)\n\nDefinition: \"Hugot\" is a Filipino slang which literally means \"drawn from a deep place\" and figuratively means \"deeply emotional\". Usually words with potentially and personally deep sentimental or emotional undertones. Because feelings come from \"deep within\" so you have had to \"hugot\" your emotions first \"from deep within\" before you would've actually blurted them out in somehow emotionally undertoned words — subconsciously or otherwise.\n\nThis online radio is fairly new but it is now attracting listeners mostly from  countries like:\nPhilippines, Saudi Arabia, Japan, United States, Morocco, Latvia, Canada, Mexico, Norway, S. Korea, Netherlands, Kuwait, Qatar, Germany, Singapore, Australia, UK, UAE and more!\n\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/HugotRadio\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/HugotRadioFB",
