In fact, I used to go to the PASS Summit with 5-6 books in my suitcase, just in case I went on a reading spurt while I was there. I've actually finished 4 or 5 books during that trip.</p> <p>Every year, I used to love to see Paul Randal's summary of his reading (<a href= \"https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/2019-the-year-in-books/\">2019 here</a>). While I don't do the data analysis that Paul does, his past posts did inspire me to use GoodReads and track my own reading. Last year, I read 128 books, most of which were fiction. I lean that way, as a way to escape from the chaos of life. So far this year I'm up to 57, though most of that was my sabbatical and the early pandemic times. Now I'm busy and slowing down the reading.</p> <p>Read the rest of <a href= \"https://www.sqlservercentral.com/editorials/summer-reading\">Summer Reading</a></p>",

One thing I often say is that if someone won't use version control, they aren't a professional. I don't say professional developer, professional DBA, or anything else. You're not a technology professional without knowing how to use a VCS in 2020. You certainly can't work for me if you won't use one.</p> <p>I saw a <a href= \"https://www.kevinrchant.com/2020/02/19/how-sql-server-professionals-can-benefit-from-using-version-control/\">nice, short post from Kevin Chant</a> on the ways in which a SQL Server professional can benefit from a VCS. Many of us working with SQL Server aren't developers, we may not be some DevOps engineer. We might be someone that manages systems or handles backups. We might be someone that deals with complex HA, DR, or replication processes.

I'm sure we had one of the smallest (and cheapest) installations of this software, which one of our executives had managed to negotiate.

I remember the first cloud service, a key-value store, which seemed woefully inadequate for most purposes. Since they I've seen the Azure SQL Database grow, and many other products get released. Across that time, I've become more and more impressed with what Microsoft has done, and as Visual Studio Team Services has expended, I've come to really embrace and get excited by the cloud.

At the time, I needed something quickly and ended up with a Logitech wireless model that included a mouse. I'm not sure of which model, but I've ended up getting two or three more Logitech devices over the years. I think I go through a keyboard every 18-24 months, though the mice seem to last longer. For me, having devices available without cords is more important for the mouse than the keyboard, but since Logitech will bundle them, I get both at the same time.

They should work early on with any staff performing testing to help them ensure that bugs are caught quickly and fewer slip through to production. At the same time, operational staff should be responsive  and helpful in all the environments software moves through. Operational staff should help build and automate the configuration of development and testing environments, ensuring that systems are built in a repeatable fashion as well as the same way in each stage of the software development pipline.</span></p>",

A tablet is actually the best option.

Colleges have students study computer science theories, languages, and more. Build small software projects, write pieces of operating systems and more as part of their curriculum. Students also still have the requirements of other core classes like science, language arts, etc., but does this train them well? I almost think that students ought to be charged with working on real projects, perhaps open source projects, and tackling some small part of the system. Perhaps an older student needs to do project management work, or architectural specifications for less experienced students that are actually programming. Is that good preparation for the real world?</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px; color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px; color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\">Read the rest of \"<a href=\"http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Editorial/110275/\">Better Training</a>\" at SQLServerCentral.</p>",

We thought it might be expensive, and hard, to get the same speakers that present at larger conferences. This event would give many of the talented DBAs in local areas the chance to speak to larger audiences than they get at many user groups. SQL Saturday has been so successful, and the growth is amazing. We've started to see more and more well known speakers traveling substantial distances to attend events. That's great, but I do worry about the lack of local speakers at some events I've attended.</p>\n<p>Read the rest of \"<a href=\"http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Editorial/110379/\">Calling Local Speakers</a>\" at SQLServerCentral.</p>",

One of the ways that I think people can do this is with a technical blog about their career. Having a technical blog allows someone to show off their skills in a particular area.

The title caught my eye because it implies that we're all doomed. Do the rest of you think that? Is it a question of when we'll have a security breach not if?</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px; color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\">Given the headlines, the news we find out about companies not disclosing security issues, the back doors and poor code in much software, is it any wonder that people think it's a \"when\" and not an \"if\"? Given the lack of realization from many companies that suffer incidents that they were even attacked, perhaps that's an assumption worth making.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px; color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px; color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\">Read the rest of \"<a href=\"http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Editorial/108527/\">If or When?</a>\" from SQLServerCentral.</p>",

We've been asked at SQLserverCentral to try and develop some articles, perhaps even a stairway to explain what Big Data is and how we might use it.
