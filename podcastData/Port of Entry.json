From KPBS and PRX, “Port of Entry” tells personal stories from this place — stories of love, hope, struggle and survival from border crossers, fronterizxs and other people whose lives are shaped by the wall.

It’s hard to compete with Hollywood. But think about it: the border has good bones for eventually becoming a film mecca. It’s one, big, super diverse place that offers access to two really different backdrops. Plus, shooting a film in Mexico is a lot cheaper. And there’s not as much red tape when it comes to permits.\n\nUnfortunately, though, a lot of large-scale production companies only think about the border when they’re thinking about movies or TV shows about narcos and drugs.\n\nLots of filmmakers only see the Mexico-U.S. border as a backdrop for stories about drug cartel violence. It’s become such a trope that “narco-fatigue” is a term now. Folks are exhausted by news and pop culture focused on the drug trade in Mexico. Yeah, it’s a huge issue here, but it’s just way over done.\n\nLocally, though, some filmmakers like Omar Lopex are using the border to their advantage, making movies that have nothing to do with narcos.\n\nAnd that trend is starting to pick up some steam thanks to efforts by local film groups that are working hard to boost filmmaking in our binational region.\n\nToday, a story about filming across borders.\n\nOnly here will you find filmmakers in San Diego and Tijuana using the border as a valuable resource instead of a janky prop.",

In addition to our long-form, deep dive episodes, we’re going to try something new by sprinkling in more low-key, casual conversations with interesting people who live cross-border lives. You'll know it's happening when you see the word \"conversation\" in the title of the episode. \n\nTo be honest, the highly produced episodes you’re used to hearing take a lot of time. Between field recordings, research, sound design and writing, it’s just a ton of work. We had to come up with a way to give our small team more time between new episodes so we can get even better at telling these longer, more nuanced stories. So that’s why we’re doing these conversations -- to give ourselves the time we need to make the best show possible. \n\nSo, in this new conversation series, we’re going to talk to creatives, entrepreneurs, influencers- anyone that embodies our binational region and can help us get to know it a little better. \n\nWe’re going to start this week with the greatest food in the world — tacos. We all love tacos and Tijuana has arguably some of the best in all of Mexico. Scott Koenig is always on the hunt for the best tacos in TJ. He's the writer behind the travel website “A Gringo In Mexico.\" Koenig has also written a book called “Seven Days in The Valle: Baja California’s Wine Country Cuisine” and he writes columns about food in Baja for several local publications. \n\nWe talk to Scott about living in the moment, immigration's wonderful effect on food and his outsider's take on tacos in Tijuana. He gives us a quick list of a few good taco shops in Tijuana and the tacos to try at each one. \n\nTacos Birria Martin: Tacos Fitos, Xolotacos\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Tacos-de-birria-Martin-178106339200263/\n\nMariscos Walter: Mariscos Ruben, Mariscos Mazateño\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mariscoswalter2005/\n\nTacos Chuy, Tacos El Vaquero, Tacos Don Esteban\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tacos.chuyjuarez/\n\nAbout the Show:\n“Only Here” is about the unexplored subcultures, creativity and struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border.

And one of the most important things we’ve learned is to think a looooot more about you -- our audience. \n\nSo, here we are, asking you listeners to do us a big, big favor and email us at podcasts@kpbs.org to tell us more about who you are, why you listen to the show and anything else you want us to know. Maybe there’s a person, place or thing you want us to cover -- we’re open to anything and everything.

And perpetually managing the pricey problem instead of actually solving the problem seems like the forever plan. \n\nThat is, unless Steven Wright and Waylon Matson’s idea gets funded. The environmentalists want to use re-purposed trash from the canyon to build retaining walls and other structures in Tijuana's Los Laureles canyon that would prevent the trash and dirt from reaching the U.S. in the first place.",

            "description": "Today, we’re kicking off an ongoing series of episodes about border art. In this episode, we talk to a guy we're calling the godfather of border art. He's the guy who helped put border art on the map: Marcos Ramírez, a Tijuana artist most people know as “Erre.” \n\nBorder art is art at the actual border fence, art about the border, and often times, it’s both. \n\nIt feels weird to say that the U.S.-Mexico border wall inspires artists. Because mostly, it pisses them off. \n\nNot to lump all artists into one sweeping stereotype, but a lot of the work being made about the border is pretty heavy in its opposition to the fence and all it stands for. It’s protest art. Or art that wants to start a conversation about power, immigration or human rights.",

But think about it: the border has good bones for eventually becoming a film mecca. It’s one, big, super diverse place that offers access to two really different backdrops. Plus, shooting a film in Mexico is a lot cheaper. And there’s not as much red tape when it comes to permits. \n\nUnfortunately, though, a lot of large-scale production companies only think about the border when they’re thinking about movies or TV shows about narcos and drugs. \n\nLots of filmmakers only see the Mexico-U.S. border as a backdrop for stories about drug cartel violence. It’s become such a trope that “narco-fatigue” is a term now. Folks are exhausted by news and pop culture focused on the drug trade in Mexico. Yeah, it’s a huge issue here, but it’s just way over done.  \n\nLocally, though, some filmmakers like Omar Lopex are using the border to their advantage, making movies that have nothing to do with narcos. \n\nAnd that trend is starting to pick up some steam thanks to efforts by local film groups that are working hard to boost filmmaking in our binational region. \n\nToday, a story about filming across borders. \n\nOnly here will you find filmmakers in San Diego and Tijuana using the border as a valuable resource instead of a janky prop.",

In fact, the only wall here at this weekly outdoor service is the one separating the United States from Mexico. Border Church is an outdoor church that meets every Sunday on both sides of the international border fence between San Diego and Tijuana. The weekly church service is a religious celebration, but it also helps ensure that Border Patrol will continue to allow people to use this place as a meeting point.\n\nThis spot, where the border wall runs into the Pacific Ocean, is where families whose immigration status doesn’t allow them to travel between the two countries can meet each other through the fence. This is the only place along the Southern California border where people can legally walk right up to the fence and touch people on the other side - just barely by poking their little fingers through holes in a steel mesh barrier, but still, it’s a touch. \n\nToday, a story about Border Church and the people who power it. \n\nOnly here can you find a weekly church service that reaches people standing on both sides of the border fence.

The transition can be challenging and emotional. \n\nAnd especially for the kids who cross, legally or not, those emotions can be intense. \n\nIn this episode, we dissect a new classical music composition commissioned by the San Diego Symphony that explores what immigration feels like for kids. \n\nWe also drop by the place where the border fence runs into the Pacific Ocean. The symphony has organized performances on both sides of the border here. It's a place with long history of serving as a backdrop for music and art focused on the border and immigration. \n\nOnly here is the symphony bringing together a composer and a poet to make music about kids crossing borders.",

            "description": "For years, Beto Soto had two secrets. \n\nAnd these weren’t small secrets. These were really big secrets. The kind that define who you are. \n\nSoto is openly gay now, but he didn’t come out of the closet until a few years ago. He's also been living without citizenship papers in the United States since his family brought him here when he was 6. He kept his undocumented status quiet until recently, too. \n\nIn this episode, we talk to Soto about being gay and undocumented, and the photographic series he made about the experience. \n\nOnly here can you find an undocumented San Diego photographer documenting what it’s like to live nearly your whole life in a country without full citizenship.",

Only Here is a podcast about that stuff — the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border.\n \nFor many, the border is just a hazy political concept. \n \nBut for the those of us who live here, the border is a very real place with a distinct culture of its own. This podcast introduces listeners to the human stories and struggles happening at the border, and the beauty and creativity that come from it.",
