# On This Topic

## Problem Statement

Most podcast players do not offer the user/listener the ability to create relationship between different podcasts such that a user looking to listen to different podcasts surrounding a particular topic can be a hard task. Popular podcast players such as Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify and Pocketcasts, classify podcasts into genres or categories. Such a general classification does not offer the listeners with the fine grained themes surrounding a particular episode, for say, podcasts such as [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) that discusses a different theme each week. Podcast players also do not offer users the opportunity to comment and rate each individual podcast episode - such as also to deny the users the opportunity to engage with other users and create a community of listeners who may share their thoughts after listening to a particular podcast episode.

On This Topic is a platform where users can engage with the podcasts themselves - on a macro level and with other users as well as find podcast episodes on any topic such as on a theme like Race, podasts that talk about/inclide a personality like [Jonathan Haidt](https://jonathanhaidt.com/) or talk about a certain place/location such as Nairobi.
